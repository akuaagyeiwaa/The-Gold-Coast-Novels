                <h2>Joseph Ephraim Casely-Hayford</h2>
                <div class="author-info">

                    <p>Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, also known by his native name Ekra Agyiman, was born on September 28, 1866, and died in 1930. His father, Reverend Joseph de Graft Hayford‚Äîoriginally named Kwamina Affua‚Äîhad his name changed by Christian missionaries, reflecting the colonial imposition on indigenous identities (Ofosu-Appiah x). Casely Hayford began his formal education at Wesleyan High School in Cape Coast and later proceeded to Fourah Bay College in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He returned to teach at his alma mater and was subsequently appointed principal of the Wesleyan High School in Accra.</P>

                    <p>Casely Hayford‚Äôs intellectual pursuits extended beyond the classroom into journalism and the legal profession. He collaborated with Prince Brew of Dunkwa at the Western Echo press and, in 1893, joined the Gold Coast Chronicle as a sub-editor. He later served as the editor of the Gold Coast Echo. During this period, he also worked as a law clerk for Mr. Eiolart, a European lawyer based in Cape Coast.</p>

                    <p>In 1893, Casely Hayford traveled to England to study law at the Inner Temple. While in England, he also matriculated as a non-collegiate student at the University of Cambridge for a year. He was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1896 and subsequently returned to the Gold Coast, where he practiced law in Cape Coast, Axim, Sekondi, and Accra.</p>

                    <p>His personal life was marked by both tragedy and resilience. His first marriage to Beatrice Madeline Pinnock produced one child, but she died in childbirth during the delivery of their second. He later married Gladys Smith of Freetown. Two of his children‚ÄîArchie Casely Hayford and Adelaide Casely-Hayford‚Äîsurvived him.</p>

                    <p>Casely Hayford's contributions to political thought and African nationalism have earned him considerable scholarly acclaim. Ugonna (1969) describes him as ‚Äúperhaps the greatest nationalist leader in West Africa of his time‚Äù (vii). His biographer, Magnus J. Sampson (1969), observes that Casely Hayford ‚Äúpursued an unremitting career of political and literary labour,‚Äù asserting that his published works earned him ‚Äúa foremost place among the men of letters of his day‚Äù (162). Sampson further emphasizes his stature by arguing:</p>

                            <p>‚ÄúStudents of British West African history will [...] concede that no remarkable career is recorded in the whole British West African politics other than that of Mr. Casely Hayford, who towered above every politician and statesman in British West Africa after [Edward] Blyden and [John Mensah] Sarbah‚Äù (160‚Äì61).</p>

                    <p>Casely Hayford was a polymath‚Äîeducationist, journalist, lawyer, politician, statesman, and patriot‚Äîwhose influence spanned multiple domains (Osei-Nyame 143). His legacy is especially significant for his literary contribution to Pan-Africanism. Unlike his contemporaries such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Edward Blyden, and Marcus Garvey, Casely Hayford was unique in having ‚Äúfictionalised the idea‚Äù of Pan-Africanism in his novel Ethiopia Unbound (Ugonna 1977, 159). In addition to this seminal work, he authored Gold Coast Native Institutions (1903), Gold Coast Land Tenure and the Forest Bill (1911), and Truth About West African Land Question (1913).</p>

                    his credentials to the Secretary for Education of the Omanhin, who, having a list of districts ready for a
                    teacher, would at once introduce the new-comer.

                    would be given to understand by the Committee that whether the schoolhouse remained empty or filled depended
                    upon his own energy and the interest he brought into his work, and, what was more, his rise to the maximum
                    stipend would be the result of the maximum success expected. As if a rule, the teachers were men who had
                    their heart in their work, and the filling of the schools was a matter of two or three months.

</P>Before this time, however, it had been discovered that the black man was not necessarily the missing link between man and ape. It had even been granted that for intellectual endowments he had nothing to be ashamed of in an open competition with the <span class="personal-name-aryan"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan" target="_blank">Aryan</a></span> or any other type. Here was a being anatomically perfect. adaptive and adaptable to any and every sphere of the struggle for life. Sociologically, he had succeeded in recording upon the pages of contemporary history a conception of family life unknown to Western ideas. Moreover, he was the scion of a spiritual sphere peculiar unto himself; for when Western Nations would have exhausted their energy in the vain struggle for the things which satisfy not, it was felt that it would be to these people to whom the world would turn for inspiration, seeing that in them only would be found those elements which make for pure altruism, the leaven of all human experience.</p>

It was no longer possible, as ' far as this race was concerned, to depict the if Sultan of <span class="place-name-zanzibar"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar" target="_blank">Zanzibar</a></span>, for example, other than as an Ethiopian gentleman, ‚Äúclothed and in his right mind.‚Äù </p>

<p>And there were sons of God among them, men whom the Gods visited as of yore; for even now three continents were ringing with the names:	of men like Du Lois, Looker T. Washington Blyden, Dunbar, Coleridge Taylor, and others‚Äî men who had distinguished themselves in the fields of activity and intellectuality‚Äîand it was by no means an uncommon thing to meet in the  	 universities of <span class="place-name-europe"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank">Europe</a></span> and <span class="place-name-america"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America" target="_blank">America</a></span>
 the sons of <span class="place-name-ethiopia"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia" target="_blank">Ethiopia</a></span>
 in quest of the golden tree of knowledge. Here, in <span class="place-name-london"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" target="_blank">London</a></span>
, about the time of write, were to be seen two young men, walking arm in arm up <span class="place-name-tottenham-court-road"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Court_Road" target="_blank">Tottenham Court Road</a></span>
, and, ever and anon, stopping to examine old dirty books in some second-class bookstall, or some quaint relics in a curiosity shop. </p>

<p>Presently, the twain stopped at a particularly ancient looking bookshop oil a by-street leading to Upper <span class="place-name-bedford"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford" target="_blank">Bedford</a></span>
 Place. The darker man of the two picked up from the stall outside, a well- thumbed copy of <span class="personal-name-marcus-aurelius"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius" target="_blank">Marcus Aurelius</a></span>
, and began carelessly to turn over the leaves. Suddenly he stopped, and his face grew pensive. Turning to his friend, he said, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it funny,<span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, the remarkable similarity of thought and almost of expression there is between all the great teachers of the past? Listen to what, for instance, -'<span class="personal-name">Marcus Aurelius</span> <script src="scripts.js">says here,‚Äù reading aloud a paragraph from the Meditations, which ran thus: ‚ÄòPray not to save ‚Äúthy child, but that thou f mayest not fear to lose him.‚Äô Now, you, a Divinity student,, what do you make of that? ‚Äù And without waiting for an answer, he added, ‚ÄúDoes it not read very much like the teaching of the holy <span class="personal-name-nazarene"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazarene" target="_blank">Nazarene</a></span>
‚Äî‚Äò He that findeth his life, shall lose it,‚Äô or words to that effect? Now, what I wish to know is what had <span class="personal-name-jesus-christ"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank">Jesus Christ</a></span>
 in common with Marcus Aurelius?‚Äù </p>

<p>"Candidly, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>
,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚ÄúI have never given the matter a thought; but since you put the question, and viewing it from a merely debatable standpoint, I am inclined to say that the first question to consider is whether <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was man or God.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> raised his eyes in astonishment. ‚ÄúYou do surprise me, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; how can you, of all others, have any doubt upon the matter? I thought you were going up for Orders.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> appeared confused, but soon regaining composure, he said to his companion, " Let us move on.‚Äù</p>

<p>As they sauntered along, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> began: ‚ÄúYou know, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I can talk better walking, and I will now answer the question you put to me a while ago. At one time I thought of taking Orders, and even now I may do so. But a little evil thing in the shape of an unanswerable doubt haunts me by day and night and it is even the self-same question I put to you at the book shop.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I hardly know what to say, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. In these matters, I, of course, regard myself as an outsider. You see we pagans come all the way here to sit at the feet of <span class="personal-name-gamaliel"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamaliel" target="_blank">Gamaliel</a></span>
,‚Äù he said with a little mischievous Laugh, and it is uncommonly hard upon us for you to entertain doubts upon the broad questions upon which we seek comparison and light. But I can conceive of no such difficulty as you experience in our system; <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> man or God? " he repeated slowly and musingly unto himself‚Äîthen turning somewhat suddenly to his friend, he said, " You know, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, since I learnt your language, not as a vehicle of thought, but as a means of‚Äîmore intimately studying your philosophy, I have been trying to get at the root idea of the word ‚Äò God '; and so far as my researches have-gone, it is an <span class="place-name-anglo-saxon"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon" target="_blank">Anglo-Saxon</a></span>
 word, the <span class="place-name-teutonic"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutonic" target="_blank">Teutonic</a></span>
 form being <span class="place-name-gutha"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutha" target="_blank">Gutha</a></span>
, which is said to be quite distinct from ‚Äò good.‚Äô Whence then, one may ask, come your ideas, as associated with the fountain of all good, of omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence? Of course they are borrowed from <span class="place-name-romans"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romans" target="_blank">The Romans</a></span>
, who were <span class="place-name-pagans"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism" target="_blank">Pagans</a></span>
 like ourselves, and who, indeed, had much to learn from the <span class="place-name-ethiopians"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopians" target="_blank">Ethiopians</a></span>
 through <span class="place-name-greeks"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks" target="_blank">The Greeks</a></span>
.‚Äù</p>

 <p>A turn or two took the young men to <span class="place-name-russell-square"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Square" target="_blank">Russell Square</a></span>
, and soon they found themselves at Bedford Place. The darker man of the two produced a latch-key, and invited his companion to come in. There was nothing remarkable about the rooms except that they were furnished in the Oriental style. Here and there, at convenient corners, were divans with rich cushions, embroidered in silk, and carpets of leopard skins into which the feet sank as one walked. On the walls were trophies, consisting principally of African weapons. There were to be seen a collection of musical instruments of all descriptions, some so simple as to make one ' wonder how any symphony could be got out of them. A well-filled shelf, with a plain oak desk, littered with written matter, with some flowers here and there, about completed the outward circumstance of the room into which our visitor was ushered. Pushing well forward the only easy chair in the room, and placing his friend in it with a smile of welcome, he threw himself upon a low seat beside him, touched a bell on a side table, and ordered some refreshment.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt mind my old-world ways,‚Äù remarked <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúYou know, though I have lived in this country fairly long, off and on, I like to sniff a bit of the African air somehow where‚Äôer I go.‚Äù </p>

<p> ‚ÄúThat is perfectly natural, at least with a well-balanced mind,‚Äù correcting himself, said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; ‚Äúbut what I can‚Äôt understand is that you don‚Äôt seem a bit Eastern in your methods of work. To judge from that pile yonder,‚Äù eyeing the notes mischievously, ‚Äúone wouldn‚Äôt think you were over here for a holiday.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, that is only a bit of derivative work.</p>

<p>You have no idea how interesting it is. Would you like to see what -I am-doing ? ‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúHow good of you! I should be delighted.‚Äù ‚ÄúI shall soon be finishing now,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> excitedly. ‚ÄúYou see I am at the letter ‚Äò Y.‚Äô And that reminds me: you remember a while ago my taking you to task over the feebleness of the idear-of ‚Äò God‚Äô in ‚Äúthe Anglo-Saxon language. -I have just got the corresponding word here in Fanti. It is a big word, so big that you can hardly manage it :‚Äî </p>

<p>Nyiakropon.</p>

<p>Does it convey any meaning to you? How can it ? And yet, I can assure you, my friend, it is no mere barbarous jargon. It is the combination of distinct root ideas in one word. It relates back to the beginning of all things visible and links the intelligent part of man with the great Intelligence of the universe. Breaking up the word into its component parts, as I have done, we have:‚Äî </p>

<p>Nyia nu/ku ara oye, pon. That is, </p>
He who alone is great?'
 <p>‚ÄúHow very suggestive. Who should have thought it?‚Äù observed <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, enthusiastically. " Well, let us take the next word, then,</p>

 <p>Nyami, </p>

<p>which is still more suggestive, and analyse it. Broken up, it stands in bold relief thus :‚Äî </p>

<p>Nyia oye emi. That is, </p>

<p>He who is lam. </p>
<p>Now compare the <span class="place-name-hebrew"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew" target="_blank">Hebrew</a></span>
 lam hath sent me, and you have it. Nor is this a fanciful play upon roots, for our people sing unto this day:</p>
<p>‚ÄòWana si onyi Nyami se?</p>
<p>Dasayi wo ho inde, okina na onyi, </p>
<p>Nyami firi tsitsi kaisi odumankuma.‚Äô</p>
<p>meaning: </p>
<p>‚ÄòWho says he is equal with God?</p>
 			<p>Man is to-day, to-morrow he is not,</p>
 			<p>lam is from eternity to eternity.‚Äô </p>
<p>‚ÄúYou can now understand,‚Äù continued <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> in a low, sad tone, " why your difficulty surprised me. But now that I come to think of it, it may be due to the limitations of your language.' 	 " After what you have just shown me, I must confess there is a deal in what you say; and somehow you Orientals manage to keep your hold on the eternal verities, where we flounder and are lost.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúPardon me, my good friend, not quite that. As yet you are only drifting, drifting, drifting away from the ancient moorings that you Westerners built in sand. <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> came from the East. In <span class="place-name-bethlehem"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem" target="_blank">Bethlehem</a></span>
  he was born, and in <span class="place-name-egypt"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" target="_blank">Egypt</a></span>
 was he nurtured; and, yet, you seek to teach Him us. We have caught His Spirit and live; you follow the letter and are tossed hither and thither by every wind. Forgive me when I say that the future of ‚Äû the world is with the East. The nation that can, Ji in the next century, show the greatest output of spiritual strength, that is the nation that shall lead the world, and as <span class="personal-name-buddha"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha" target="_blank">Buddha</a></span>
 from <span class="place-name-africa"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" target="_blank">Africa</a></span>
 taught <span class="place-name-asia"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" target="_blank">Asia</a></span>
, so may Africa again lead the way.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI am not prepared to dispute the matter with you, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and there seems to be a good deal of truth in-what you say; but how about the doubt deep down in my own heart? That is a personal affair you know. In a word, what think you of the Christ ? ‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúWhat a clever dialectician you are, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, l to be sure? If_I_did not know you so well,  I would hardly think you were serious. You throw back to me the question I put to you a while ago, and you lay upon me the burden of solving my own riddle.‚Äù </p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs voice was low and sad with a suspicion of emotion in his whole manner, as he said: ‚ÄúForgive me, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> if I have seemed flippant; I was never more serious in my life. I have arrived at a crisis in my career which may mean disaster at any moment; and, what is more, until this day I have never had the courage to' speak it out to any of my friends for fear they would mock at my doubts.‚Äù</p>

 <p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> turned upon his friend a look full of penetration and sympathy; and, for the moment, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> felt uneasy under the searching glance of the Eastern student. It seemed to him as if in that instant <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had probed his inner nature and found it shallow. </p>

<p>According to our ideas, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, one broad (divinity runs through humanity, and whether we are gods, or we are men, depends upon how far we (nave given way to the divine influence operating upon our humanity; and, comparing one system with another, I must confess there was in the man Christ Jesus a greater share of divinity than in any teacher before or after Him, and that was in my mind when I was wondering what <span class="personal-name">Marcus Aurelius</span> <script src="scripts.js"> had in common with <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>.‚Äù </p>

<p> ‚ÄúBut tell me, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, supposing <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had been born of an Ethiopian woman instead of Mary of the line of David, do you think it would have made any difference in the way he influenced mankind? ‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat a strange question,‚Äù returned <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; ‚Äúour Lord born of an Ethiopian woman?‚Äùforgetting his doubts for the moment‚Äî‚Äú Whatever put such an idea into your head? I am sure you are the first man who has given expression to such a thought.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, it is strange ‚Äù‚Äîand there was "a vibration of the intensest pathos in <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs voice  ‚Äî‚Äú that an African should venture to think that the Holy One of God might have been born of his I race. I can easily interpret your thoughts; but, I tell me, what is there extraordinary in the idea? " I " Oh, I don‚Äôt know. Habits of thought, convention, and all 'that sort of thing, I suppose. And yet I am hardly qualified to speak upon these things,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, softening.</p>

<p> He rose to go. He was due farther west to see his people. Before leaving, he laid a hand on <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs shoulder, and looking gravely into his face, he said: ‚ÄúIt is a pity, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I did not meet you a little earlier in my career. But even now, it may not be too late. Good-bye! Mind you meet me at <span class="place-name-liverpool-street-station"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Street_station" target="_blank">Liverpool Street Station</a></span>

                            <p> SILENCE prevailed in the room, except for the stitch, stitch, stitch, of a woman past the early bloom of womanhood who, at first stitching merely to pass away the time, now thrust, the needle j' viciously into the embroidery, as if bent upon ' drawing some secret from the heart of the silken cords of life.</p>

<p>Presently she began to cry‚Äîhot burning tears  which flowed from the passion of a heart which nought for rest and found none. </p>

<p>The curtains were down, and, save a glowing lire which a young student kept poking for no reason at all, the atmosphere of the room, as far ns these two souls were concerned, was in strange keeping with the fog outside. They were man and wife, these two, at least before God. Of his own free will he had made love to her in far away Africa, and she had responded. But that was years ago. She, then, a buxom, lively lass, he an intelligent youth of the National University. She, now in <span class="place-name-england"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" target="_blank">England</a></span>
, only a nurse-maid; he a successful student, equipped and ready to carry all the world before him. Yes, they were man and wife, these two; yet were they both ill at ease, and the young man would have willingly trusted himself to the tender mercies of‚Äîthe London fog. Yet he could not go. It was the law of compensation. He was fairly caught in his own meshes, and fate called upon him to face the music.</p>

<p>To do Tandor-Kuma justice, for that was the youth‚Äôs name, he had always intended to remain steadfast in his promise to <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. But now the circumstances were changed, and he was doing his best to grapple with a most difficult situation. How could he, a professional man, used to all the luxuries of English life and habit, take back with him to start a career in Africa a nurse-maid ? And what would he do, if asked to Government house? Thoughts such as these passed through his mind and-made him obdurate to the pleading of the woman a his feet.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúIf you cry again, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I shall leave you.  You know it is-too bad when I am doing all my best to amuse you in this horribly depressing weather.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, you needn‚Äôt trouble about that, Tandor- Kuma. I know you will leave me in any event. You don‚Äôt think I have lived all these years without knowing what you men are. You press weak women into your service, and when you have won their sympathy, for a dream you toss them away like this,‚Äù viciously kicking at the rug before the fire.
‚ÄúNow, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, try and be reasonable. You mustn‚Äôt think I am going to desert you. Bad as we men are, we have our ideals, and we never rest until we realise them.‚Äù
 ‚Äú Good! That beats all the cant I have ever heard! What is the next, pray? And women have no ideals, of course! Uncultured women do not feel, do not think! They are just like clay in the hands of you men to mould‚Äîto make or mar.‚Äù</p>

 <p>" Now you are getting angry. Let us discuss this matter dispassionately.‚Äù</p>

<p> Instead of that, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> burst into a paroxysm of grief which Tandor-Kuma found it hard to control. By degrees, she grew calmer, and, sticking a pin or two in her head-gear, she snatched up her wraps and stood ready to depart. " </p>

<p>Tandor-Kuma,‚Äù she said, " you have your ideals, and I have mine. Let us part like friends.  I shall not give you the opportunity of dismissing me like a cur. Good-bye, of the present! It may be we shall meet again.‚Äù And before the young student could frame a suitable answer, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was gone. </p>

 <p>The Mfantsipim National University had, about the time that these studies open, been already doing good work- in Fanti-land. It had its origin in the national movement which swept over the country in the stormy- days of 1897, when the p Unpeople, as if moved by a sudden impulse, rallied round the Aborigines Society and successfully established the principle of land tenure under which the country has since thriven. </p>

<p>It had been felt for a long time by men of light and leading in Fanti-land that the Salvation of the people, depended upon education that to educate the youths of the country properly depended upon trained teachers; and that it was the work of a university to provide such training ground. </p>

<p>The people did not wait for endowments from the, rich and the philanthropic, or for money-making syndicates to start the work; but quickly collecting a few enthusiastic young men, these went about from province to province and from village to village trying to instil into the commonalty what the country lost by the neglect of education. The people began to understand and to talk about the matter in the wayside places. So that when Jubilee Day came round, and from province to province throughout all the states of Fanti-land the gong-gong of the Amanhin went round for contribution by the people to the National Educational Fund, great was the enthusiasm of high and low, and there was not a <span class="personal-name-hamlet"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" target="_blank">hamlet</a></span>
 throughout the land which did not send its fair share of contribution. Even the children threw into the Kruba in the market places their three- penny-bits. </p>

<p>Among the enthusiastic band who canvassed the educational question was <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and none more ardently than he. He was a man of remarkable intelligence, who, receiving the best education the schools of those days could afford, had, by hard work and natural taste for book- learning, so impressed the community with his ability that at the age of nineteen, he had been entrusted with the editorship of the national newspaper, and had already come to be regarded as one of the coming leaders of the people. </p>

<p>Upon the opening of the National University, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> gave up newspaper work and joined the University staff. He was foremost in bringing forward schemes to prevent the work of the University becoming a mere foreign imitation. He kept constantly before the Committee from the first the fact that no people could despise its own language, customs, and institutions and hope, to avoid national death. For that reason the distinctive garb of students, male and female, was national with an adaptability suggestive of the advanced state of society. It was recognised that the best part, of the teaching must be done in the people‚Äôs own language, and soon several text-books of known authority had, with the kind permission of authors and publishers, been translated into <span class="place-name-fanti"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fante_people" target="_blank">Fanti</a></span>
 thereby making the progress of the student rapid and sound. </p>

    <p>The scheme involved, as it has been shown, the turning out of efficient teachers, and as the University was affiliated to that of London and in working correspondence with some of the best teaching institutions in <span class="place-name-japan"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" target="_blank">Japan</a></span>
, England, <span class="place-name-germany"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" target="_blank">Germany</a></span>
, and America, the work done was thorough. A young man or woman obtaining a certificate as a trained teacher-was sure of work in any part of the country at a recognised salary. Upon arriving in a province, all that the teacher would have to do would be to present his credentials to the Secretary for Education of the Omanhin, who, having a list of districts ready for a teacher, would at once introduce the new-comer. Generally he would find a suitable school house with all necessary appliances, but not the children; and he would be given to understand by the Committee that whether the schoolhouse remained empty or filled depended upon his own energy and the interest he brought into his work, and, what was more, his rise to the maximum stipend would be the result of the maximum success expected. As if a rule, the teachers were men who had their heart  in their work, and the filling of the schools was a matter of two or three months</p>

<p>The thirst for knowledge spread so rapidly that men and women took to attending night schools where they quickly picked up reading and writing in their own language, and such was the general eagerness for learning that translation work had become a distinct feature of the work of the University. Hence at the time that he made the acquaintance of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, he was engaged upon derivative work in London. His health having given way somewhat as the result of excessively hard work, he had been recommended to go away for a bit, and taking advantage of the opportunity, he had visited Japan, Germany, and America to study their methods, winding up, as he planned out in his own mind, with a visit to England. </p>
<p>
  By this time the outlook of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span>  upon life was broadening; and the young man was beginning to cast in his mind the most useful avenue by which his life‚Äôs work could be best accomplished. While he thought upon these things, that Divinity which shapes our ends, whether we understand or no, was shaping matters in a way for <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> that he could hardly anticipate.
  By a resolution of the University authorities, while in London, an offer came to him to continue his-stay for a period of three years certain, for the purpose of superintending the publications of several standard works in the vernacular that the University had arranged to bring out.
  When the offer came, he at once closed with it, seeing therein a way to the fixing of his future career. And so the die was cast. Having private means of his own, he joined the <span class="place-name-university-of-cambridge"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a></span>
 read jurisprudence for a year, and having then joined the <span class="place-name-inner-temple"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Temple" target="_blank">Inner Temple</a></span>
, had, at the time that we met him along <span class="place-name-tottenham-court-road"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Court_Road" target="_blank">Tottenham Court Road</a></span>
 in the company of <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span>, settled down in London to read law in grim earnest

 <p>In the far-away home in Africa, where <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was born and bred, he had known, a little orphan girl who attracted attention I wherever she went by her simple, unaffected ways. She must have been under the ministration of some <span class="place-name-guardian-angel"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_angel" target="_blank">Guardian Angel</a></span>
, for if ever a person grew in favour with the gods and men, it was she. Daily she was to be seen in the temples of Nanamu, and no one was more attentive, or worried the old priest afterwards with such knotty questions. She was born well, and, having passed through a course in the University, was now visiting Europe for the first time to put the finishing touches to her education. </p>

 <p>When <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> parted with <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, the latter made his way to <span class="place-name-holborn"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holborn" target="_blank">Holborn</a></span>
and wandered aimlessly down <span class="place-name-oxford-street"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Street" target="_blank">Oxford Street</a></span>
, his mind full of varied thoughts. He had always been a thinker, and this morning in his conversation with <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> fresh avenues of thought had opened up in his mind which he wished to pursue undisturbed. As he watched the mighty procession of men, women, and children jostling one another, he was overwhelmed with a sense of the weariness which European civilisation had evolved for itself. But it was of the teaching of the <span class="place-name-christian-philosophy"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_philosophy" target="_blank">Christian philosophy</a></span>
 and its paradoxes that his mind was full. Was it not the Nazarene who said: "Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give rest ‚Äù ? Had he given this people, who professed to be his followers, rest in their constant attempt to overreach one another, in the way they trampled upon- one another unto fame and fortune? Again, he had called all his followers brethren, and was not his the injunction to go forth and teach all nations that all might be brethren? And, even now, the words of '<span class="personal-name"> Silas Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, Divinity scholar of Queen‚Äôs: ‚ÄúWhat a strange question! Our Lord born of an Ethiopian woman! "‚Äîagain rang in his ears. What if <span class="personal-name-bishop"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop" target="_blank">Bishop</a></span>
, prelates, in the direct line of Him, Who made Himself of no reputation, felt the same, and I yet dared to "propagate his gospel among the Ethiopian Gentiles? Were there to" paradoxes all the way through? A religion which taught one thing, and practised another, was it worth following? And in his inmost heart he found himself thanking the gods that he was a poor benighted pagan according to the formula of the Church. </p>

<p>In the frame of mind in which <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was, he was in no temper to be disturbed; but as , luck would have it, he had not gone far when he saw coming towards him a dark man, known among his fellows as the Professor. He professed all things and knew nothing in particular. He was in reality Kwow Ayensu, a student of several years‚Äô standing at the <span class="place-name-charing-cross-hospital"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charing_Cross_Hospital" target="_blank">Charing Cross Hospital</a></span>
, to whom, as far as one could judge, the question of a medical or a surgical diploma was of a secondary consideration. <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> dodged the Professor and made for the opposite pavement. The Professor as promptly crossed over, and familiarly tapping him on the shoulder, said in a gruff voice, ‚ÄúHallo! old fellow, how are you? I have not seen you for quite an age; and what is the meaning of cutting an old chum like this, eh? ‚Äù</p>

<p>Evidently there was no getting away from the Professor, and so <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> resigned himself to his fate. ‚ÄúThe fact is,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúif you want me to be frank with you, I wanted to be alone. I was so enjoying myself before you interrupted me I love to observe without being observed.‚Äù</p>

 <p>"Do you include in your observations that of humanity in general ?‚Äù dryly put in the Professor. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúTo me it is the most interesting study, and the best theatre I find to be these very pavements, the performers being the moving throng of men and women. To study humanity in this guise is to me the acme of intellectual pastime, and much as I would like a chat with you another time, I am really sorry you disturbed me.‚Äù " Your case,‚Äù said the Professor, ‚Äúis a simple one of cerebral contraction of the sympathies come with me, old boy, to the <span class="place-name-argyle-rooms"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyle_Rooms" target="_blank">Argyle Rooms</a></span>
 to night, and I warrant you the finest study of humanity anywhere in London. You may notice without being noticed, and if you should fee inclined to thaw, by Jove you will have your world cut out. Some of the latest arrivals are rare bits and they-are-the rage of all the young hounds misnamed-mem Do come with me.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI thank you for the kind invitation, but I am afraid I cannot come to the Argyle Rooms with you to-night, as I must catch the night train to <span class="place-name-cambridge"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge" target="_blank">Cambridge</a></span>
 with a friend.‚Äù</p>

<p>"Well, then, come with me to the York Hotel instead. It may be I shall be able to interest you, and, if you please, you may stand me a treat after. I hear some of you ‚Äôvarsity chaps are very good that way. Your average rusty London student does not understand champagne suppers and that kind of thing.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúIf it comes to that, Professor, we needn‚Äôt go all the way to the York Hotel. We can just drop in at Slater‚Äôs round the corner, and I will warrant you as good-a-lunch as you ever tasted. Come along now I will take no refusal.‚Äù </p>

<p>It did not take much to persuade the Professor, and together they were soon seated at a well- appointed table in a comfortable corner. After lunch the Professor said to <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚ÄúOne good turn deserves another. I thought I would give you a bit of a surprise, but since the mountain would not come to Mahomet, I suppose he must go to it. The fact is, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> is in London, and is staying at the York Hotel with her father.‚Äù</p>


 3.
 <p>When <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> called at the hotel the next day to pay his respects he was surprised to learn that, an hour or so previously, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> and her father had taken the train for <span class="place-name-harwich"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harwich" target="_blank">Harwich</a></span>
on their way to the Continent. The girl had always expressed a desire to see the principal countries of Europe, and as her father had a little business in the south of Germany, she had coaxed him, on the plea that it yet wanted a fortnight before she would be due to enter college, to take her with him. So pleased she was with her German surroundings, that when her father was returning to London, she was loth to come with him; and as she had always shown a decided inclination for music, it had been decided she should remain at school there for a year or two to pursue her studies. Time passed and <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had no news of <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. All the Professor could tell him was that her father had returned to Africa, and the young lady was pursuing her studies on the Continent. </p>

 <p>In the meanwhile, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was quietly reading in the Temple. They were eventful years‚Äîthose three short years in the heart of the metropolis. The science of jurisprudence had always attracted him. It opened to him vistas of justice and fair play between man and man, which strongly appealed to him. The influence of the stoical writings over the Roman jurists, producing a Law of Nations, showed him a way by which the nations of the-earth, yielding to higher impulses, might mete out justice to the weak races of mankind. Moreover, the opportunity which it gave him of comparing the institutions and customs of his own country with other systems was an endless source of delight to him. Now was his opportunity to fit himself for the battle of life. He read, not for examinations, but for information. He drank freely from the vital springs of knowledge and found his soul satisfied. He could not help feeling that he had a call to duty, and that in the service of his race.
At the time of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> being called to the Bar he had invited to London for a day his friend <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. After the ceremony they repaired to the Haymarket to hear <span class="personal-name-mr-beerbohm-tree"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerbohm_Tree" target="_blank">Mr. Beerbohm Tree</a></span>
in the part of <span class="personal-name">Hamlet</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. As the curtain did not rise till 8.30, and the evening was particularly fine, they walked down to the theatre from the Temple, and the conversation naturally turned upon Shakespeare‚Äôs masterpiece. </p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I have never forgotten the conversation you and I had three winters ago along Tottenham Court Road, and I have been going deeply into the matter. I have been comparing the worship of <span class="personal-name-osiris"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris" target="_blank">Osiris</a></span>
 by the Egyptians of your own race, the <span class="place-name-akkadian"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language" target="_blank">Akkadian</a></span>
 philosophy, the religions of <span class="personal-name-zoroaster"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster" target="_blank">Zoroaster</a></span>
, of <span class="personal-name-buddha"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha" target="_blank">Buddha</a></span>
, and of <span class="personal-name-confucius"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius" target="_blank">Confucius</a></span>
, the teachings of the <span class="place-name-greek-mysteries"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_religion" target="_blank">Greek mysteries</a></span>
, and of the <span class="place-name-stoic-writings"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoic_philosophy" target="_blank">Stoic writings</a></span>
, and the farther I have gone into the matter the more puzzled I have become as to the right of the people calling themselves Christians to a monopoly of <span class="place-name-divine-light"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divine_light" target="_blank">Divine light</a></span>
. And as to the term ‚Äò<span class="personal-name-heathen"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heathen" target="_blank">Heathen</a></span>
,‚Äô I think it I arrogant for any devotee of any one sect to apply it to another. There is as much sense in it as the <span class="place-name-ancient-greeks"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_Greeks" target="_blank">Ancient Greeks</a></span>
 dubbing all others <span class="place-name-barbarians"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian" target="_blank">barbarians</a></span>
. Here we are to-night, for instance, going to hear a play written by one <span class="personal-name-william-shakespeare"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" target="_blank">William Shakespeare</a></span>
, a Christian gentleman, who flourished in the reign of <span class="personal-name-queen-elizabeth"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth" target="_blank">Queen Elizabeth</a></span>
. I dare say if I stood in the pit of the Haymarket to-night, and made an open statement that<span class="personal-name"> William Shakespeare </span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>was a gentleman, but I had my doubts as to whether he was a Christian, I would be hooted down and hissed out of the theatre. Yet a superficial reading of some of his works will convince you that his sentiments, if he wrote from his inmost self, which he must have done, great poet as he was, were far from those of a Christian. See how <span class="personal-name">Hamlet</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> nurses in his bosom a feeling of revenge so poignant as to find satisfaction killing the wicked king only at a moment when he will fall with, all his sins upon his head. It reads like the work of a heathen, and yet I dare not--suggest that <span class="personal-name"> William Shakespeare </span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>was a heathen at heart." <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> burst into a hearty laugh. " </p>

<p>Unless you have read Jevon to little purpose, you must admit that that argument is faulty. Yet I cannot help- agreeing with you that the word ‚Äòheathen' is a relative term, and perhaps your average Englishman has no right to call the average Ethiopian heathen.  Ours was the <span class="place-name-cradle-of-civilization"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization" target="_blank">Cradle of Civilization</a></span>
, and that it had not the permanence I that the <span class="place-name-christian-civilization"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_civilization" target="_blank">Christian civilization</a></span>
 is likely to have does not make it any the less a civilisation; and I, for one, feel nothing but pity for the kind of ignorance which scoffs at what it does not understand.‚Äù </p>

<p>The speaker stopped somewhat abruptly and eyed the listener curiously. After a second, he continued:</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know perfectly well, my good friend, that I am not a Christian. If not, what am I?. Perhaps delicacy may forbid you saying what you think. But, believe me, I am not ashamed to be called pagan, or heathen, or by any other such pet word. With all due respect to <span class="personal-name-st-paul"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul" target="_blank">St. Paul</a></span>
, we worship that we do know. The fact of the case is, that from the days of the great teachers of Christianity you Christians have not taken the trouble to understand any other system but your own.‚Äù</p>

<p> "You know, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, turning off the subject, I have taken my degree, and I am soon due for ordination,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. " But all these years the reason and the faith within me have been in such deadly conflict as to leave my senses reeling. Yet the die is cast; I have given my name into the Bishop; I cannot look back for fear of breaking my mother‚Äôs heart.‚Äù '</p>

 <p>‚Äò‚ÄòI am sorry for you, my dear friend,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúbut, perhaps, you don‚Äôt look at the matter from the broad point of view that an outsider can look at it. I know, of course, something of the religions of the past. I have studied our" own Eastern systems and compared them with the system you Westerns have adopted, and find that one broad divinity as well as humanity runs through them all. You will grant, I think, that there was something that lifted man to God in all the systems you have named, and in others of which, as yet, you know nothing, and that some of the founders of these systems, such as <span class="personal-name-epictetus"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus" target="_blank">Epictetus</a></span>
, <span class="personal-name-cleanthes"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanthes" target="_blank">Cleanthes</a></span>
, Buddha <span class="personal-name-gautama"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" target="_blank">Gautama</a></span>
, were men whose ideals of self-suppression and communion with God were of no mean order. I am free to say that there is a marked difference between them all and the Christ, as much as there -is a difference between the stoical -writings and the <span class="place-name-gospel-of-st-john"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John" target="_blank">Gospel of St. John</a></span>
. <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was a living, breathing, God- in-man personality, linking human son-ship with <span class="place-name-divine-fatherhood"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Fatherhood" target="_blank">Divine Fatherhood</a></span>
. Buddha Gautama, for example, never truly realised his own son-ship with God as to reveal that relationship to man. He - strove to pierce the secret of the universe, but never quite succeeded. Then as to reason and faith and the load of doubt‚Äîwell, if you ask me whether the birth of Jesus 'Christ was a natural birth or a supernatural one, as an outsider, all I can say is, I don‚Äôt know, nor does it matter one jot whether it was the one or the other. Similarly, if you ask me whether He did ascend into Heaven with His bodily form, defying the <span class="place-name-law-of-gravitation"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation" target="_blank">Law of Gravitation</a></span>
, I say I don‚Äôt know, nor does it matter. But this I do know, that His life and work and His interpretation of the ways of- God with man may so draw one to Him as brother, friend, master, and, through Him, to God as Father, <span class="place-name-almighty-sovereign"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almighty" target="_blank">Almighty Sovereign</a></span>
, Benefactor and Guide, and that should be enough for the average man whose object is not arrogantly to question high Heaven, but to make his way thither humbly and piously.‚Äù </p>

<p>When they arrived at the theatre the curtain was just up, and, for a moment, they were engrossed in the simple setting of the play for which Mr. Beerbohm Tree is so remarkable in his Shakespearean representations. In Scene III., where Polonius utters the precept: " Beware of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in, bear‚Äôt that the opposed may beware of thee,‚Äù <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, poking his t friend in the rib, whispered, ‚ÄúThat is Christian sentiment with a vengeance.‚Äù</p>

<p> When the curtain next went up, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> drew the attention of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> to a bevy of dark girls with an elderly man, who seemed to be playing the part of <span class="place-name-chaperon"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperon" target="_blank">Chaperon</a></span>
, and who were soon joined by a couple of young men. <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> followed the direction indicated by <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and nearly jumped out of his seat with excitement.
 "What is it, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>?‚Äù asked <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. " You generally are so cool.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúPardon me, but the fact is, I must introduce you at once. Those are my friends the <span class="personal-name">Abans</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> and I am very much mistaken if the young lady at the corner is not Miss <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. Come along!‚Äù And he literally dragged <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> after him. </p>

<p>The old gentleman saw the twain coming in their direction, and beamed all over with delight. He was a good-hearted soul, and loved to see the sons of Ethiopia acquit themselves honourably in a strange land, and he had heard nothing but what was good of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. The enthusiasm with which <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was greeted by his friends struck <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> forcibly, and he did not at all notice the few seconds that passed before he was introduced. </p>

<p>During the interval, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, who hated all crushes, preferred to remain where she was, so <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> fetched her some refreshment, and stayed to talk to her.
‚ÄúSo you deserted us for the Continent without a moment‚Äôs notice. It was really bad of you, and I hope you have made up your mind now to make full amends.‚Äù</p>

 <p>"Yes, I didn‚Äôt like the life here,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúSomehow it didn‚Äôt suit me. Besides, I had no friends here, and as my father was going away, I felt I could not stay.‚Äù	</p>

<p> "You must have found <span class="place-name-stuttgart"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart" target="_blank">Stuttgart</a></span>
 congenial, to judge from the length of time you have been away. Your father has been telling me a little about it, and I hoped to hear more from you.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúOh! that must be another time. See, the curtain is about to rise, and here come trooping in the <span class="personal-name">Abans</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. You know we arrived only this afternoon by the <span class="place-name-dover"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover" target="_blank">Dover</a></span>
 train, and met the <span class="personal-name">Abans</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> at the hotel; and as they were coming to see <span class="personal-name">Hamlet</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, my father thought it would be nice for us to come with them.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúNow, that reminds me, by a stroke of ill-luck, I arrived at your hotel the day you left for the Continent half an hour too late, to find the bird had flown.‚Äù
<span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> felt a little confused; and just then the curtain rose. </p>

<p>The rest of the play interested <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> little, and he was not at all sorry when cheer after cheer called Mr. Tree over and over again before the footlights to receive such an ovation as few artists have received before or since.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúMind you call before I leave for Africa,‚Äù said the old gentleman, as <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> and <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> said good-night.</p>

<p> The friends talked little on their way back to the Temple, and <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, divining what was passing in his friend‚Äôs mind, respected his silence.! ' Before separating for the night, however, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> said, ‚ÄúAllow me, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, to thank you for giving me such an agreeable evening in such a Cultured company. Your friends, by Jove, are a credit to Africa, and it makes me feel inclined to lead a crusade against narrowness and prejudice.‚Äù </p>

<p> ‚ÄúThank you so much. I am glad you think so well of my friends. I hope you will sleep well after all the day‚Äôs dissipation.‚Äù This, as <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> showed his friend to his room. </p>


4.
<p>For the next few weeks, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> and <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> saw a good deal of one another. From the first, there was a congeniality between the two which went to make all intercourse natural, pleasant, and spontaneous. It was as if they had known one another all their lives; and it seemed the most natural thing that henceforth their joint lives should run in the same tenor. One day, as the twain sat chatting over an afternoon cup of tea, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> fetched a letter from a writing-table and, carelessly spreading it out, said: </p>

<p>‚ÄúI forgot to tell you, when last you were here, that I have been offered the post of head-mistress of the junior classes of our home university. I am sure you will be delighted with the idea, for I am going to accept it, and my father agrees with me.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can you think of such a thing?‚Äù burst out <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> almost indignantly. </p>

<p>His manner was so sudden that <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> could not possibly control herself. </p>

<p>‚ÄúNow, what have I done to call for such sharp treatment? ‚Äù she demanded firmly, yet playfully. </p>

<p>‚ÄúForgive me, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, if I have spoken with unwonted heat, only I was thinking‚Äîwell, I was thinking you might teach me instead.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúWhat an absurd idea! How can I teach such a big, strapping fellow like you? "said <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúBesides, you are so clever. Surely, you mock me.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúBelieve me, my dear child,‚Äù and there was a slight tremor in the manly voice, ‚ÄúI was never more in earnest in my life.‚Äù</p>

<p> <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> seemed puzzled. After a little hesitation, she said: </p>

<p>"You call me ‚Äòchild,‚Äô and yet you would have me believe that I can teach you. Can you be serious? ‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I am quite serious. ‚ÄòAnd a little child shall lead them,‚Äô ‚Äù he quoted. " I was hoping,‚Äù pursued <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúthat yours would be the task to teach me the way of duty, and that, when found, you would help me to tread it.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúBut how do I know what your duty is ? Who can tell better than yourself ? Moreover, the gods of our fathers can teach you it, if you need guidance. Don‚Äôt you know that, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>? ‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I know that. But this also I do know, that the gods are wont to make use of human instruments in approaching men. The Infinite finds expression in the finite, and the ideal is realised in the actual. And it has often occurred to me that the child-like hand that shall guide me through life‚Äôs labyrinthine ways is the self-same one that I now hold tenderly in my own.‚Äù </p>

 <p>She began to understand. She made an effort as if she would withdraw her hand. She hesitated, and the next moment she surrendered the other also.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúYou will be my teacher, then? "asked <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, half-persuasively, half-triumphantly. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she simply answered. ‚ÄúSo may the gods of our race help me‚Äù.</p>

<p>As the days passed, the twain grew in that mutual understanding, the true basis of all happy unions. Now and again he would tell her of his prospects, which he laughingly said were nil, having inherited little else beyond a clear head and a willing heart for work, with which he hoped they would be able to forge their way in life together; to which <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> would sweetly say that she wished she had a fortune to make things easy, but since she had it not, she would bring him the next best, a loyal heart and true, at which <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> would chide her, and say that was the best of all. </p>

<p>Little by little, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> told <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> all that had happened in her little life since the days he knew her as a child of ten.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she said, talking to him one day, ‚ÄúI often invoked Nanamu that I might be permitted to travel to see a little bit of the world, and it seemed they heard me; for soon after, my father took it into his head to visit Europe with me after I had successfully passed my examinations at our university. When we arrived here, the life of the people seemed to me artificial. Perhaps I could not have expressed my feeling then in those words, but, anyhow, I felt as if I was not in my proper element. Chance took me to Germany. I found things very different there‚Äîthere, in the <span class="place-name-black-forest"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest" target="_blank">Black Forest</a></span>
, I got into direct touch with Nature; the song of the birds, the bleating of the lambs, the fragrance of the fields, all seemed so natural, and I said to myself: Here is my proper place; here the atmosphere wherein my nature may expand. The rest you know. And now, what think you of the result? "</p>

<p>For answer, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> caressingly drew her nearer to his side. </p>

<p>Summer was waning into autumn, and the chrysanthemum and the sweet mignonette were in bloom, when the lovers decided upon marriage before returning to Africa, where <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was to start a practice. It was to be a simple affair, at which there were to be no bride‚Äôs-maids or groom‚Äôs-men, and only the nearest friends were to be asked. <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> appeared in church on the wedding-day in a simple African costume of her own design, tastefully got up, and when someone asked her the reason for her choice, she said she knew it would please her husband, and, besides, it answered best to her own conception of what was proper. And, ‚Äúso, these were wed,‚Äô‚Äô to employ <span class="personal-name-tennyson"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred,_Lord_Tennyson" target="_blank">Tennyson</a></span>
‚Äôs words.</p>

 <p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was not long in taking up the duties of life in grim earnest with his dear little , wife to cheer and to comfort him. From the first success smiled upon them, either as the result of honest, strenuous effort, coupled with natural ability, or as a mark of the favour of the gods, or both. Gradually they built up a big practice, and by the time their little boy was able to toddle from room to room, and call ‚ÄúFadder! Mudder!" they had a sweet little home of their own, with plenty of flowers, and sunshine, and love, and God‚Äôs blessing. Five short, very short, happy years of mutual love and association, and then there came; a cloud which, for the moment, seemed to <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs breaking heart and tearful eyes without the silver lining; for, with the advent of their second born, a sweet baby girl, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, poor wife L and mother, paid with her life for that of her child, who, as though she could not stand the gloom she had brought to this once bright home, soon joined her mother, and made the former gloom twice gloomier, and father and son were alone with a twice two-fold bond of love between their souls and the souls of those that had gone before. </p>

<p>And when his little boy of three asked <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>: ‚ÄúWhere is ‚ÄòMudder?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere is Sissie?‚Äù he would say : ‚Äú ‚Äò Mudder' is gone to God, or Sissie is gone to God,‚Äù as the case might be, and would turn aside his face, lest his little one might know the full extent of their woe.</p>

                            <p> But he had also prayed for light, for he knew, according to the teaching of Nanamu, the priests and prophets of his <span class="place-name-tribe"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe" target="_blank">tribe</a></span>
, that Love and Light dwelt together in the highest heaven. </p>
2.
<p>To him who saw this vision, the idea of death was familiar. Among his people, at break of day, as men passed one another in the market-places, they would greet one another and say, ‚ÄúAkioo,‚Äù meaning, hail friend, thou yet livest. And if a man slept and woke no more, they would say he is gone to Nanamu-Krome, and, if he had been a good man, his friends would make <span class="place-name-libation"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libation" target="_blank">libation</a></span>
 to him, claiming his protection and guardianship in the ordinary affairs of life.</p>

<p>He had been a father once before‚Äîthe happy husband of a happy wife in a home where love dwelt; and when death first took the wife and then the new-born babe, he left darkness behind where first was light. It all looked so strange. He only half realised it in the first flush of his sorrow. But as the days wore on, and the old familiar chair by the hearth remained vacant, the darkness in his heart seemed to deepen. </p>

<p>Gradually the light of understanding dawned upon his soul. He came to know that the spiritual side of love was of far greater value than all else beside, and read a spiritual meaning into the offices of love. Sorrow was the path that led him to the innermost shrine where he met God, the Nyiakropon of his race, and understood. He could stand by the open grave of his beloved‚Äî open, because by spiritual sympathy he could see her as she was‚Äîand say: ‚ÄúI kiss these flowers ere I lay them on thy bosom; and when I say ‚ÄòI, I do not mean this frail body of mine, which is but a casket. Hear me, beloved! I mean the soul in me, that which can have and has communion with thee, soul with soul, and spirit with spirit, how it does not matter. See, I throw thee a spiritual kiss, and I know thou returnest kiss for kiss, even as of yore.‚Äù Yes, he had touched the depths of human happiness and the depths of human sorrow, and had come to know that the way to God led from the one to the other. </p>


3.
<p>The physical strain had been too much for <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. A lurking disease had begun to show dangerous symptoms. A hurried consultation had resulted in the doctors deciding upon an operation. He received the news with wonderful calmness. He rejoiced secretly in the prospect of the unconscious condition of the senses through which he would pass, and hoped against hope that  the intelligence of his nature, freed from earthly trammels, might be free to concentrate themselves upon things spiritual, and given a glimpse of the city of the ancient dead of his race, where he was sure his beloved dwelt. It was a wish born of sincere anticipation which flew on the wings of prayer to the Father of Spirits. As he passed off, he was heard to murmur softly the name of his wife, but none knew that, like <span class="personal-name-jacob"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob" target="_blank">Jacob</a></span>
 of <span class="place-name-hebrews"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrews" target="_blank">the Hebrews</a></span>
, he had wrestled with God and prevailed. </p>

<p>In another sphere, as if from a dream, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> awoke, and, though he possessed not his physical body, as it seemed to him, he was sure of his identity as ever he had been. He commanded the full use of his intelligence, and the scene around him, though weird, was by no means unfamiliar. He had the feeling of one who, travelling to a far distant country, and, for the nonce, forgetting the physical aspects of his native land, upon returning, in a moment, recalls the old place again. But it was not without misgiving, as he gradually took in the scene around. It was at the outskirts of the city, not built by men, that he found himself. For walls the city was surrounded by a great lake whose water was as clear as crystal, to attempt to cross which were madness for a mortal without aid. </p>

<p>As <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> stood doubting within himself what he should do, and deploring the presumption which made him wish to encompass knowledge not destined for man, suddenly there appeared before him a being of such untoward mien that he was anxious, to fly from his presence, if he only knew how. It had the aspect of a human being, but so distorted were the features, and so woebegone the expression, that, he looked to all appearances half man and half beast. Finding no possible way of escape, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> took courage, and thus addressed himself to the monster: ‚ÄúSir, I am a mortal from the nether sphere, which men call the earth, and, unbidden, I have sought to catch a glimpse of this glorious city which now I find it were death for mortal to enter unaided. Pardon my presumption, but tell me how I may gain entrance into yonder city, where I may find her I whom my soul loveth.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúThou hast well spoken in that thou hast mentioned the word ‚Äò love.‚Äô If truly thou art moved by love, then art thou not far from thy quest; and since thou hast uttered the password, I will tell thee the way, which lies in simple trust. Hear me and understand. I was a mortal like unto thyself. I was ambitious and arrogant. I hoped to scale high heaven by knowledge and by the work of man‚Äôs imagination. I tried and failed, and I am what I am. The gods, in anger, hade me stay here and point to mortals the way to the city beyond, which I may not enter for full thousand summers, as thou measurest time, until my iniquity be purged.‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúI do not understand thy speech,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚Äú If thou art minded to help me, tell me simply how I may cross over the lake, and win my way to the glorious avenues beyond ? ‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDid I not tell thee that the way lies in mere trust ? I have very little to add. Examine thine own heart, and if there is aught in it that is not sincere and true, thou mayest not enter in.‚Äù </p>

<p>Then, suddenly, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> bethought him how in the temples of his native land, he was wont to bow the knee to the God of Love. So, all else forgetting, bending the full force of his will to the task, even on the banks of this impassable lake, he knelt in fervent prayer that he might have courage to cross over. And as he prayed he seemed to enter into advance, gradually losing consciousness of his immediate surroundings. When he awoke there stood before him a beautiful youth, clothed in a raiment of the fineness of gossamer, which fell in graceful folds about his person. His feet were encased in sandals of crystaline transparency, and his head encircled with a chaplet of lilies of the valley. </p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was about to speak, but the vision raised his forefinger to his lips in token of silence, and then in a voice full of pathos and sympathy said, ‚ÄúMortal! thy prayer to the God of Love and Light hath been heard, and thy homage of love and trust met with favour, and I am bidden to lead thee across into yonder beautiful city; but, remember thou, that it is only so long as thy courage doth not fail, that thou- canst safely cross over, that being the bridge over which mortals may enter." But fear not; thy love hath broken asunder the gates of death, and none may bar thy progress.‚Äù </p>

<p>Thus listening, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> suddenly found himself walking on the face of the crystal lake, and his companion with him. And when his heart began to fail him, he thought of his beloved, and took courage. Now and again he would seem to be sinking, only to rise again buoyant on the wings of confidence renewed; and soon the crystal lake was passed. There the vision left him, telling him his mission was ended, and he wot not what to do.</p>

 4.
<p>While in this state of uncertainty, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> heard distant echoes of children‚Äôs voices, so melodious was the strain, and, in harmony, far beyond aught he had ever heard. He strained his senses to hear more, and as the voices drew nearer, he was seized with a sudden wish to behold the beings from whom those sweet cadences proceeded. And that he might see unseen, he hid himself amidst the flowers which grew in rich profusion outside the city walls. </p>

<p>He had hardly done so, when lo! there came trooping past a procession of young children, with' palms in their hands, which they waved aloft, as they sang, and the burden of their song was: ‚ÄúCome, let us go to the Father‚Äôs house; this day he bringeth his children joy; the sun of salvation is setting fast.‚Äù So sweetly simple were these children, and the only thing striking about them was the purity of their countenances and the lofty grace with which they carried themselves. <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> greatly wondered when he recalled to mind the angelic presence which had a while ago left him. As the procession neared the city, the company seemed to break into little groups, and to disperse in different directions. They played and gambolled and made fun, and, in all, there was nothing fantastic or weird‚Äîso intensely human were these children of the air. </p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the keeper of the gate had hied him into the city, even to that part thereof ' which faces the rising sun, where a goddess dwelt. Thus the keeper of the gate addressed her, bowing low: ‚ÄúHonoured among women! I am bidden by Nyiakropon, the father of the gods, to bring thee news of the coming of a mortal into the holy city of Nanamu. Since thou art a goddess, thou must know that since thy translation from nether earth', he whom thy woman‚Äôs heart prizeth above alt honour and glory hath constantly set himself to purifying his heart and his ways, if haply he may find the way to thee; and since he is faithful, the constant desire of his heart, forced on the breath of fervent supplications, hath pierced the heaven of heavens and reached the ears of Nyiakropon, wherefore it hath been decreed that thou, honoured among women, should be the first goddess in Nananu-Krome to receive a mortal who hath won his way to the holy gates. Arise, shake off thy grief, and prepare to receive him whom thy soul loveth.‚Äù </p>

<p>Him gratefully hearing, the goddess <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> arose, and commanded the maidens to get all things ready, so that her coming Lord might not feel strange in the city of the immortals. And with music and with frolic did <span class="personal-name">Katsina</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, her little daughter, superintend all. As for <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> herself, to the house of praise did she proceed, and, out of the fullness of her heart, did give thanks to Nyiakropon. Before the holy altar she knelt, and raising her heart in Thanksgiving, the emotion of her heart so overcame her, that she wot not how to begin, or how to end her thanksgiving. </p>

<p>And wherefore was the goddess moved, and whence the emotion of her heart! Scarcely could she veil from memory an earthly scene of unparalleled pathos and solemnity, as the hour of parting came. It was the last day of the fever which burnt out her earthly life. There, in the old familiar chamber, in the home where dwelt love and light and all that she then, untutored, prized dearest in heaven or on earth, stood husband and child‚Äîtheir first born, bone of their bone, flesh of their flesh, so full of promise. She knew her hour had come, and she must needs die, and her little woman‚Äôs heart rebelled against the decree of the gods. An inward struggle seemed to be going on within her at that critical moment. At last she was heard to ejaculate: " Oh, God, see where stand my husband and my child. I cannot bear to see their grief-stricken faces. If it be Thy will, spare me to them. But, if not, not as I will, but as it seemeth good to Thee.‚Äù It was a bitter struggle‚Äîthis struggled the heart‚Äî if haply it might secure its dearest wish against the decree of heaven. But she was sincere in giving Nyiakropon the choice. She had fought and won, and the highest heaven had sealed the victory. Thus the passing away of <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. As for <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, hope ever more sprang up youthful in his heart. Over and over again he found himself wondering whether his beloved was truly dead, or dead only to his physical senses. And, confidence renewed, evermore building upon adamantine foundations, wafted a vow to heaven that his one quest would be to learn the way to her. </p>

5.
<p>‚Äú<span class="personal-name">Katsina</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, mine; said the Goddess <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚ÄúI want" you to attend to what I am about to say. Ever since you came to me in answer to my tender call, I have taught you that but a thin veil divides Nanamu-Krome from the nether world where thy father and brother dwell, and that the veil is drawn, whenever it pleaseth heaven, for converse between immortals and men. This day shaft thou see thy father, for, even now, he is within the city walls at the main gate. Go, bid him welcome to Nanamu-Krome, for I may not go to him yet. Joyously did the maiden saunter forth to do her mother‚Äôs behest, and, even at the main gate, as she had been forewarned, she met her father to whom she said, ‚ÄúHail, father! Mother hath sent me to welcome thee home.‚Äô‚Äô At this <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was startled beyond measure, but, not wishing to betray his bewilderment, he said, ‚ÄúI do not understand, little maid; pray, who may thy mother be, and how knew she that-I was here?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo you not know me, father?‚Äô‚Äô said the damsel, half reproachfully. ‚ÄúMother told me you were coming, and so I ran to meet thee; but how she knew you were here she did not tell me. But, you know, mother is a goddess, and she knows a good many things.‚Äô‚Äô The saying surprised <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and he turned it over in his mind what it might mean. Was it possible that the devotion and the trust and the love of his girl-wife had blossomed into a personality which was half god and half human even in the nether world? The case of his little girl was easy to understand, for he had caught the import of the words of the poet who wrote:</p>

<p>‚ÄúDay after day we think of what she is doing</p>
	<p>In those bright realms of air;</p>
<p>Year after year, her tender steps pursuing,</p>
	<p>Behold her grown more fair.‚Äù</p>

<p>Yes, she was fairer than the lilies, brighter than the sunbeams, purer than snow-flakes‚Äîhis own little <span class="personal-name">Katsina</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> in this realm of light, and yet he had prayed for her return. For a moment he was lost in thought, then suddenly turning to his little girl, he embraced her with all the warmth of a father‚Äôs heart, and eager to learn all he might of his girl-wife, he said, ‚ÄúTell me, dear, what may a goddess be like? "</p>

<p> ‚ÄúHow funny, father, what am I like?‚Äù Have I not hands and feet and lips to return kiss for kiss? And suiting the action to her words, she covered the bent face of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> with kisses. Even as the home-sick traveller, returning to his native shore, suddenly recalls distant echoes of the past, so did <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> begin to catch glimpses and to recall impressions of the sacred abodes of Nanamu-Kromc. It seemed to him, as if in some bygone age from this self-same abode of the ancient dead, the gods had sent him on an errand to mortals! Even as he thought, the impression deepened in his mind, that one day the gods had said to him: ‚Äú<span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, this day we send thee forth into the nether sphere to be for us a witness unto the-truth; for mortals are ever wont to go away from the truth, whereupon we gods are ready to destroy them. Go, as a thinker among the thoughtless, convince them of their error, proclaim unto them the sovereignty of truth and the eternal majesty of Nyiakrapon, the god of truth.‚Äù It seemed to him that in obedience to this call, he had gone forth, full of courage, full of zeal, resolved to obey the command of the gods; and lo! before his work was half done, here he was, as it were in a dream, back to Nanamu-Kromc. lie shuddered as he thought upon these things, and greatly feared lest he had stirred up the anger of the gods against himself by leaving undone his duty. What would he have to say to his wife upon meeting her this very day! </p>

<p>Meanwhile, his little daughter poured into his ear, child-like fashion, the story of the abodes of the ancient dead. But with all her childish ways, there was something remarkable in the way she put things. A turn or two soon took them to the principal highway of the city of the immortals; and here there burst upon his view a scene which filled him with awe curiosity. It was simple, yet majestic, ethereal yet earthly; and one feeling uppermost in him was that he had seen the like before in some forgotten age. For a busy, noisy thoroughfare with multitude of men hurrying hither and thither, there were, as it seemed, a number of peaceful avenues, wearing  beautiful green, like unto moss, which met in one grand broadway Each avenue was edged with luxuriant shrubs and plants whose leases showed the most delicate tints of the rainbow in beautiful blend. Here and there lifted their sinewy arms giants of the forest not unlike the <span class="place-name-cedars-of-lebanon"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedars_of_God" target="_blank">Cedars of Lebanon</a></span>.
The different walks seemed designed with an eye to quiet contemplation. Now and again the avenues ended abruptly in an ingeniously laid-out garden from which again avenues continued to the broadway. Here and there burst into view magnificent temples. The temples, as <span class="personal-name">Katsina</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> took pains to explain to her father, had been raised by immortal hands, not for prayer, hut for praise. A service of praise was just ending, as the twain arrived at the portals of a beautiful temple, and presently the avenues teemed with a moving throng, but with all the congregation, there was neither hurry nor bustle. The men were robed in a kind of loose garment over which was thrown in graceful folds across the left shoulder a raiment of the softest material, crimson in colour. They-wore sandals on their feet and garlands of red roses and lilies intertwined around their heads. The crimson shade of their apparels showed that they had passed through the narrow gate, of sacrifice; the roses in their chaplets were for a token that over the bridge of sorrow they had passed into the joy of Nanamu-Krome; and as for the lilies they merely pointed to the truth that humility becometh well the triumphant. Sandals they wore, because they had borne the heat and the burden of the day, for full oft in the Sahara of life they had had occasion to cry :‚Äî</p>

<p>Ekwan yi owari, Nyiakrapon </p>
<p>Whe bra ma ahedzi yina atsistsihea</p>
<p>Na Minan aprepra, a pre pin, mutu ontu‚Äô  </p>
<p>Naasu wuada na wayi da wayim,</p>
<p>Ga'm Kwan, Nyiakrapon! </p>
<p>meaning : </p>
<p>The way is long, Nyiakrapon, </p>
<p>Behold the torn and scattered garment, </p>
<p>And the bleeding feet that can scarce move on‚Äô</p>
<p>Yet to thee only I may look. </p>
<p>Oh ! guide me Nyiakrapon ! </p>

<p>One thing struck <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and it was this: the teeming multitudes represented every kindred, race, people, and nation under the sun. It was a congregation of select souls, men and women who had humbly done their duty, and done it well, in another life. That was all. </p>

6.
<p>By now the mansion of the Goddess <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was within view, and <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> could faintly decipher certain words writ large on the portals. The characters scintillated as if done in living fire; but, upon nearer approach, he noticed that the effect was produced by the silvery beams of a moon-like orb which, by day and by night, gave life and light to the abode of the gods. Thus <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> read: </p>
<p>"Lead thou me on, Nyami,</p>
<p>And thou, o Destiny,</p>
<p>Whithersoever thou ordainest,</p>
<p>Unflinching will I follow;</p>
<p>But if from willing heart</p>
<p>I will it not, Still must I follow! "</p>

<p>He read and pondered, and the more he thought of them, the more he wondered why they were written over the portals of <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs place. And while <span class="personal-name">Katsina</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> ever and anon impressed a point, bidding her father note this or that particular temple, even while she was yet warm in her account, they had arrived at the outer court of the mansion, and, saying, ‚ÄúThere is mother come to meet us,‚Äù with a cry of joy and a run, she was in her mother‚Äôs arms.</p>

 <p>‚Äú<span class="personal-name">Katsina</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> mine, run into the inner court and quickly set fruit and wine for thy father, for he must be weary after a long journey.‚Äù So saying, ' She slipped past the child, and, in a moment, husband and wife were locked in a happy embrace; but even as the panting heart, after long waiting, at last receiving that which it had yearned for, breaks down and cries aloud for joy, so did the twain sob on one another‚Äôs neck. </p>

<p>‚ÄúCome, ‚Äôtis not seemly for us to give way like this when the gods have been so kind to us, nor must a goddess show weakness in many tears.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI forget; <span class="personal-name">Katsina</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> told me so,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, starting back.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúHow silly of you,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúlook at me, is there any difference between what I was and what I am, or can aught that may befall thee or me in time or eternity, save neglecting the will of the gods, make me less thy captive, thy bond maiden? ‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúTis well said. But since thou inquirest, I must own that I sec in thee a grandeur of soul,  a depth of emotion, that mere mortals do not possess. Yet could I spot thee out among a thousand women. Tell me, art thou in very truth a goddess? ‚Äù </p>

<p>"Yes, I am a goddess; for Love is of God, and God is Love. And so art thou a god, only thy warfare is not yet accomplished. And to this intent was thy prayer heard and leave ordered thee to visit this sacred about that thou --- carry hence a knowledge w 11 am e in thy work.‚Äù </p>

<p>"I can understand you being a goddess, but, surely, you mock me when you suggest that I am a god. Call me a thinker, a teacher, call me any-thing that is of the earth, but a god I cannot think that I am one, or can ever be.‚Äù</p>

<p> A look of pain passed o‚Äôer the countenance of <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> as in subdued tones she said : ‚Äú It is even as it was revealed unto me. Yet another aeon must pass over thy head before thou comest to thine own, before thou enablest me to add the finishing touches to thy habitation. All these years I have waited for the fruits of my suggestions, as thy guardian angel, and though thou hast learnt much, yet hast thou more to learn, even the lesson of simple trust. A little more doubting on thy part, and thou mightest have lost the chance of seeing my face this day. Yet how my woman‚Äôs heart hath longed for thee‚Äîfor a full and a lasting reunion.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúPardon me, beloved, you talk of trust and seem to sorrow for my want of it. Believe me, I shall learn to trust more. But as for a habitation for me in this city, it is more than I can understand. Have pity on my simplicity, for I am but a mortal.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI talk of naught, husband mine, that a mortal may not understand. Ever since my translation, I have watched over thee, even as a mother hen watches over her brood. Oft might‚Äôst thou have faltered, but that I prayed for thee, and my prayer was-heard. Scarcely dost thou rise to the level of thy opportunities. Though a mortal, thou art a thinker, and, even among gods, none may rank higher. By knowledge God planned out the heavens, and laid deep the foundations of the earth. Only thou allowest full oft cold reason to usurp the place of simple trust, and in this thou art harder to learn than a little child. Now, hearken, unless thou becomest as simple and as trusting, aeon after aeon shall pass o'er thy head before our final reunion.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚Äò‚ÄòIt grieveth me to think, dear one, that the time for reunion is with me, and yet I command it not; but think not 'tis willingly done. Tell me, do you mean trust in little things as well as in great, in temporal matters as in matters of higher moment? " </p>

<p> ‚Äò‚ÄòYes, my beloved, light beginneth to dawn upon thy soul. Simple trust, remember, honoureth Nyiakrapon. Listen  When thou returnest to earth, opportunity will be given thee of preparing in this school, and oh! may‚Äôst thou be apt to learn. </p>

<p>For our beings must be rounded off, and every phase of our development completed, before translation. And for this purpose are we given opportunity after opportunity until the work of pruning be accomplished. It is all but the finishing touches that are required to thy habitation. Each mortal buildeth for himself a habitation in this sacred place. Some build of stone; some of stubble; unhappy they who raise their hopes upon the shifting sand.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúYet thou speakest of the finishing touches being put by thee to that which is of my own building. Guardian angel mine, explain!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúTruly, it is of thine own building. No one may build for another. Even love, such as mine, is helpless in such a case. Come with me, and I will show thee the structure that thou are raising for thyself.‚Äù </p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> followed, greatly wondering what the full meaning of <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs words might be. Close to the mansion of the goddess was rising up a new structure of considerable beauty and strength before which <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> paused lingeringly. </p>

<p>"Behold,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthe symmetry of this building. It is such as displeases not the gods. Yet, if thou perceivest clearly, thou wilt see a seam here, a fissure there, unevenness in places where there should be uniformity. Much as I love you, beloved, I cannot be unmindful of thy imperfections. Reunion may not take place till thou hast laid the apex to a character, fit for a god to dwell in.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúOnce more I fail to understand. How can my character form a dwelling place for a god?".</p>

<p>‚ÄúYe shall be as gods, knowing good and evil,‚Äô ‚Äù quoted <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, with sweet emphasis, more to her- self than to her husband. Then fixing on him a look of tenderest sympathy, she said, ‚Äú In the beginning evil and-good were created, and to man was given the command to rule and subdue the evil, and to foster and cause the good to prevail. That is the final reason of human experience, and man becomes a god when he has won the victory. It consists in the building of character, and one star may differ from another star in glory. When I mortality-fails, the immortal in man prevails and finds its home here where, in the cycle of the heavens, in the case of great souls, it becomes a god dwelling in the temple which character hath fashioned. The temple hath truth for foundation, love for superstructure, and child-like trust for apex. Do you now understand, beloved? ‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, guardian angel mine‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor encouragement,‚Äù continued she, ‚Äúbeholdest thou yonder rising tower in the structure which thou art raising for thyself whose pinnacle shimmers in the light of heaven? ‚Äù <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> bowed assent. ‚ÄúThat is courage,‚Äù said the goddess. "It stands somewhat prominently in the edifice, as thou canst see.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúBut you puzzle me,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. "I have little courage, as men think of it and preach it. I love not the strife of mortals, neither do I excel in deeds of valour nor of strength wherein, as I understand, the gods delight have done no heroic deed in my time that I... I have won no battles, led no squadrons triumphantly against the hosts of men.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù broke in the goddess, with a slight gesture of impatience. ‚Äú I know you have done none of these things. But wotest thou not as yet that I speak not of earthly things, and that, therefore, earthly comparisons are worthless ? To love strife, to excel in deeds of nerve, to be leader in campaigns of slaughter ‚Äî none of these is accounted great or courageous by the Father of the Gods. But to love truth, and to serve under its banner, come what may, that is courage truly, which will endure and stand the test of endless ages.‚Äù Then turning upon him a look of intensest scrutiny and deepest sympathy, she continued: </p>

<p>Behold, you will stand before kings and princes and mighty ones of the earth to testify against ! corruption and wrong in high places in the name of truth. Thou hast courage, and the stars in their courses shall aid thee. And now take this message to the sons of men, and I give it thee as an emissary of the gods. Say unto the mighty that the cry of the afflicted and the. distressed among the sons of Ethiopia has come up to us, and we will visit the earth. For gold the oppressor will find tinsel, and for precious stone adamantine rock which will fall upon the tinsel and grind it to dust, and the wind will scatter that which is ground unto the four corners of the earth, and men shall see it and wonder at the work of the gods. Lo! Nyiakrapon will establish in Ethiopia a kingdom which is different from all other kingdoms. <span class="place-name-mammon"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammon" target="_blank">Mammon</a></span>
 will have no place therein, and an angel of light, with a two-edged sword, shall guard the gates thereof.‚Äù</p>


<p>‚ÄúAnd in order that thou mightest not falter by the way, when thou returnest to the earth, go to the city beautiful, the mother of the world, unto the part that faceth the setting sun, and thou shalt find a vestal virgin whose altar of love it hath been ordained should be lighted up by thee in incense to the God of Love.</p>
<p>Go, she is true; thou hast my leave, and fare thee well!‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúBut ‚Äù‚Äî<span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> began.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúI know what-thou would‚Äôst say,‚Äù put in the goddess. "To obey is our present duty; and remember simple child-like trust is the apex of all‚Äîfor thee as well as for me. It may be I shall come to thee, if need shall arise. So long as we trust, it will all come right. Go, and again, fare thee well I " And, as an anxious father, watching by the side of a dying wife, restrains the anguish of his heart, lest his little ones might know the full meaning of their woe, even so did <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> restrain the anguish of her soul before her husband. </p>

<p>‚ÄúFather, mother says I am to come back to thee in the other world. I wonder if you will know me when I come ? " <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs eyes filled with tears. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúYes, I will, darling,‚Äù he simply said.</p>
<p>When <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> awoke, the work-a-day world was going on in its accustomed way, and the old earth still revolved upon its axis in the same duration of time. And the sunlight chased the shadows, and the shadows chased the sunlight, and there seemed to be strife in the elements, but not the strife of mortals. It was effort co-ordinating with effort, and Nyiakrapon ruled over all.</p>
<p>The new-born child opened her eyes upon a mysterious world. In her face was a puzzled look‚Äîa look of half doubt and half knowledge. After a few playful years she flitted away. Men talked of a ripe soul. There was one who understood, but said nothing, and that was the father of the child. </p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>In the year of grace, 1904, there was no such thing as a water supply in the town of <span class="place-name-sekondi"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekondi" target="_blank">Sekondi</a></span>
, the pet little preserve of His Majesty‚Äôs Gold Coast Government. Nor was this in any way strange. The Government and the people of the Gold Coast had always depended upon Providence for such a common necessary of life as waters so, it happened, that when the Metropolis was ‚Äúbeing laid out into ‚ÄúHigh Streets‚Äù and open spaces, it had not dawned upon the authorities that man was a thirsty animal, and this notwithstanding gentle reminders on the part of experienced men in the past. If you search the Colonial archives, (you will find that in the eighties of the old century Dr.<span class="personal-name">Lamprey</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> of the Army Medical Service proposed a simple scheme for supplying the ancient town of <span class="place-name-cape-coast"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Coast" target="_blank">Cape Coast</a></span>
 with fresh water.  The Government went to sleep over the proposal, nor did it wake up over the suggestion to lead the waters of Homo to <span class="term-accra"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accra" target="_blank">Accra</a></span>
, the headquarters of the Government. As matters stand, when Providence fails the Metropolis, men are known actually to resort to soda water for the daily <span class="place-name-ablution"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablution" target="_blank">Ablution</a></span>
.</p>

<p> Now, if you want to see Sekondi at its best and the water question at its worst, you must approach the town in the month of March on one of Messrs. Elder<span class="personal-name">Dempter</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>'ss boats, at the season of the year, that is to say, when other parts of the country already being bathed in refresh showers. As you round off <span class="place-name-takoradi"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekondi-Takoradi" target="_blank">Tacradi</a></span>
 Bay, you see the mother of Gold Coast civilisation enveloped in a sheet of overhanging clouds charged with electricity. The side view that is presented shows a city of great promise. Already there are signs of the heavens giving way, and raindrops patter on the ship‚Äôs deck. But even while you are wondering what a wet landing you are going to have, a blaze of light breaks out on the north-east, and the Titan of the upper sphere leaps forth triumphantly over thunder and storm. As you divest yourself of your mackintosh, a cynical old coaster says to you: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Sekondi all over; I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the tanks are all dry.‚Äù</p>

<p>In other parts of the world harbour works generally precede railways; but here an apology for a pier-head does service for harbour accommodation. The result is you have to land in an open boat often with an angry surf surging around you. Let us assume, however, that you have landed safely. If you had known Sekondi in the days of its pristine innocence, you will find that an iron bridge now spans the ancient natural boundary between <span class="place-name-english"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people" target="_blank">the English</a></span>
 and <span class="place-name-dutch"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people" target="_blank">the Dutch</a></span>
 towns. From the echoes beneath proceeds forth the monotonous dirge of an asthmatic engine which appears to be trying to do the work of two engines in a climate which, according to some, is bad for man, beast, and locomotive. </p>

<p>Where once stood the English town and the uplands beyond, one can see at sunset a number of well-arranged wooden houses on brick pillars, looking quaint-and striking in the distance, but disappointing upon nearer view. At the foot of the hill lies the railway station, the first sign of civilisation, as you meet it on the Gold Coast. It is the terminus of the ‚ÄúGreat North Western" of the Gold Coast. And a beautiful line it is with its sprightly curves and gradients and its thirty- nine miles in something like three hours. But I am anticipating.</p>

<p> If you are hot in a hurry to descend, you may come with me the Manager‚Äôs bungalow from the spacious verandah of which you can catch a bird‚Äôs-eye view of Sekondi, bathed in the twilight, as the sun moves leisurely in the western sky right into the bosom of the mighty ocean. So restful is the scene! </p>

<p>If you know the history of this town, a momentary sweep of the eye will bring back to memory signs of a former strife; for overlooking the Bay, there stands the old Fort, a symbol of the strife between the Dutch and the English in pre-locomotive days. The struggle, in name, was between two European nations, in reality between two aboriginal factions, who, for aught one knows to the contrary, might have otherwise lived in peace. The Dutch or the English flag was the standard which drew the natives in thousands into opposing camps, and for which they shed their blood freely, only that the white man might obtain freer scope to barter spurious drinks for the precious metal which the torrential rains washed to the very doors of <span class="place-name-aborigines"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" target="_blank">the Aborigines</a></span>
. </p>

<p>It is a sad reflection, but a legitimate one, that in the present day the successors of the leaders, who bore the heat and the burden of the day in order that British commerce might gain a footing on these shores, are not remembered as they should be by the British Government. But it is true that they are protected; it is feared very much protected. To be accurate, they are remembered sometimes in the partitioning of their territories, the minimising of their authority, and, worse than all, in some cases, in the sowing of those seeds of discord, calculated to destroy the integrity of a people. </p>

<p>The work of destruction, speaking generally, goes on not in the light of day, but, metaphorically, in the dark hours of night. The mighty Titan, does not knock down his victim and deprive him of life outright. Oh no! that would be too crude a way. With the <span class="place-name-gin"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gin" target="_blank">gin</a></span>
 bottle in the one hand, and the Bible in the other, he urges moral excellence, which, in his heart of hearts, he knows to be impossible of attainment by the African under the circumstances; and when the latter fails, his benevolent protector makes such failure a cause for dismembering his tribe, alienating his lands, appropriating his goods, and sapping the foundations of his authority and institutions. To apply Tennyson‚Äôs simile, the Titan only knows what the Titan wants, or what he means. And all the while the eternal verity remains that the natural line of development for the aborigines is racial and national, and that this is the only way to successful European intercourse and enterprise. The situation could not be better hit off than in the suggestive lines of <span class="personal-name-guy-eden"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Eden" target="_blank">Mr. Guy Eden</a></span>
 who, with marvellous insight, has written in the "King of the Blacks‚Äù :</p>

 <p>‚ÄúClad in the civilised rags of humanity, </p>
<p>Blear-eyed and shaggy, he limps down the street,</p>
 <p>Grinning about him with childish urbanity,</p>
 <p>Begging of all whom he chances to meet.</p>
 <p>Begging, but not for sound garments to cover him,</p>
<p>Nor for the food that he longs for, you‚Äôd think.</p>
<p>No, for a civilised passion is over him,</p>
<p>All that he asks and he craves for is drink! </p>
<p> "But in the days long before the white man appeared,</p>
 <p>Here on this spot where a town was unknown,</p>
<p> Hunger and thirst were two things Billy never feared, </p>
<p>Round him was planty, and all was his own.</p>
 <p>All was his own, tribe paid their court to him,</p>
<p>Called him the King, in those days that are past, </p>
<p>Subjects in scores all their loyalty brought to him, </p>
<p>First amongst men was he then‚Äînow, the last! </p>

 <p>"Where are all they who would make such a ‚Äòbobbery‚Äô</p>
<p>Roaming the bush like glad children at play, </p>
<p>Where the mad whirl of the tribal ‚Äòcorrobboree,‚Äô</p>
 <p>Where the wild chaunt at the close of the day? </p>
<p>Scattered and gone, for the world had no room for </p>
<p>them, </p>
<p>Far o‚Äôer the seas came the pitiless cry: </p>
<p>Why should they live? Fate has writ large its doom </p>
 <p>for them,</p>
 <p>Land for the whites ! Let the black fellows die! '</p>
 <p>" ‚ÄòLand for the whites I ' Aye, the answer came speedily,</p>
 <p>Civilisation, with hot eager stride, </p>
<p>Sweeping upon them with maw gaping greedily,</p>
 <p>Swallowed them up in their pitiful pride.</p>
 <p>see there the last of them, King in the days of old! </p>
<p>Now ‚Äômidst the lowest he takes the last place. </p>
<p>Purely some day, when the story of life is told,</p>
 <p>Angels will weep for the last of his race!‚Äù </p>

<p>But we were taking a passing view of Sekondi, and our companion was none other than <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. We have retraced our steps over the railway bridge, and are now in Dutch Sekondi. </p>

<p>On the left wing of the street are a number of substantial business houses looking defiantly down upon a small building of four bare walls which represents <span class="place-name-wesleyan"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesleyan" target="_blank">the Wesleyan</a></span>
 tabernacle at Sekondi. </p>

<p>The spot upon which this simple building stands is historic. Here, half a century ago, was waged the civil war between the English and the Dutch, in which the good African missionary,  <span class="personal-name">Kwamina Affua</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, who had been baptised by the good missionaries as <span class="personal-name">James Hayford</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, sometime British Resident at Kumasi, an ancestor of <span class="personal-name">Kweku Atta</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and a brother of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> the then Omanhin of Cape Coast, lost his life. As peacemaker, he had gone to help separate the combatants. In the struggle he was brutally, though perhaps, unintentionally, struck down. Peace be to his ashes! It is a sacred spot, and no wonder that the stars in their courses would seem to fight against the powers of mammon in their efforts to dislodge the worshippers. </p>

<p>It being the hour of prayer, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> followed the crowd inter the holy edifice, resolved to see for himself the result of fifty years of missionary effort. He noticed familiar faces here and there. There was,<span class="personal-name">Kwesi Yaw</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, who was quite a kid, and a carpenter‚Äôs apprentice, in his school days at Cape Coast. How he had aged! The lines of care were thickly marked on his face. Yonder was <span class="personal-name">Esi Maynu</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> , who used to be the laundry maid at the old boarding establishment. Marks of age were upon her too; and when he remembered how gay and sprightly they, the young people, were in those bygone days, a sense of sadness came over him. </p>

<p>What were they doing here? They had come to worship, of course. Did they worship, or did they not, in those far away days when they, the young people, joined hands together in the moonlight under the open sky and sang Sanko songs ? Even then, to <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, the words of their familiar Sanko were full of meaning; and as he listened to-day to the-wheezing sound of an old harmonium upon which a missionary boy was performing, he could not help thinking how much his people lost their ways to those of the white man. For a harmonium they had castanets with which they kept time as one of their number,<span class="personal-name">Kobina Edu</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>  it was, gave the solo of the favourite Sanko while they joined in the chorus. He remembered the words so well, and readily recalled them: </p>

<p>Mi sankofu, wo nwhe bra yaku apa,</p>
 <p>Inwhe bra wumba arku auiay; </p>
<p>Aryarsa, ye yi wu be ye biada! </p>
<p>Obiri, Osawu si ay!</p>
<p> Adapazci, osawusi, </p>
<p>Mimpona, bada miyamv. </p>
<p>Afi. yi na nisini ya funa! </p>
<p>Anapawi, mi dofu, mimpona ba da miyam! </p>
<p>Meaning : </p>
<p>Companions mine, see how well we‚Äôve struggled,</p>
<p> Behold how far thy children have striven;</p>
 <p>If so be, we shall still struggle on!</p>
 <p>She is black and comely, she is like unto her sire!</p>
<p>Morning star, thou art like unto thy sire!</p>
<p> My sweetheart, come to my embrace; </p>
<p>My Saviour, come to my bosom. </p>
<p>How wearied are we this season! </p>
<p>Morning star, sweetheart mine, beloved, come to my</p>
 <p>embrace! </p>
<p>How simple, how natural, how spontaneous all this was compared with the refrain of ‚ÄúDare to be a Daniel,‚Äù composed and sang by <span class="personal-name-ira-sankey"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_D._Sankey" target="_blank">Ira D. Sankey</a></span>
, which the missionary boy, with so much effort, was trying to play in tune. Those were the days of healthy Fanti manhood. The nation has missed the promise of her prime, and is likely to bow her gray hairs in sorrow and shame to the grave. </p>

<p>The congregation was composed for the most part of children, clad each in a few fathoms of Blanchester home-spuns. At the head of the choir was the schoolmaster whose attire certainly invited attention. In his elegantly cut-away black morning coat and beautifully-glazed cuffs and collar, not to speak of patent leather shoes, which he kept spotlessly bright by occasionally dusting them with his pocket handkerchief, tucked away in his shirt sleeves, he certainly looked a  veritable " swell,‚Äù but he also did look a veritable fool. </p>

<p>And this was the sum total of half a century of missionary zeal and effort. Could it be for this that the simple good-hearted fathers of our race had suffered and died? They prayed for light for themselves an' for their children‚Äôs children. But instead of light, say ye Gods, does not darkness brood over the land?
The preacher was a white man, preaching to a black congregation; and outside on the front wall of the holy edifice was to be seen a notice which informed all whom it might concern that there would be a service for Europeans in the Club House at the station at a certain hour that day. <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> turned away in disgust. </p>

<p>Later in the day he came across Essi Maynu, the selfsame laundry maid of old days. He said to her: ‚ÄúDo you remember me, <span class="personal-name">Essi</span> <script src="scripts.js">?‚Äù She looked him up and down, and made a move as if to embrace him, but she checked herself. </p>

<p>"What‚Äôs the matter,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúDoes your new religion teach you to be shy of old friends ? Now, to show you that I, at least, am not changed, I shall come round this evening with some of my Sankofu, and shan‚Äôt we have a nice time with music and with dance? ‚Äù She raised her eyes in holy horror as much as to say : ‚ÄúGet thee behind me Satan.‚Äù</p>

<p> <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> retreated like a beaten man; but the lesson was not lost on him. Henceforth he was resolved to devote the rest of his life in bringing back his people to their primitive simplicity and faith. And, in that resolve, he mused upon the words ‚ÄúBushido-(Shintoism) offers us the ideal instead of wealth, humility in place of ostentation, reserve instead of reclame, self-sacrifice in place of selfishness, the care of the interest of the State rather than that of the individual. It inspires-ardent courage and the refusal to turn back upon the enemy. It looks death calmly in the face and prefers it to ignominy of any kind. It preaches submission to authority and the sacrifice of all private interests, whether of self or of family, to the common weal. It requires its disciples to submit to a strict physical and mental discipline, develops a martial spirit, and by lauding the virtues of courage, constancy, fortitude, faithfulness, daring, self-restraint, offers an exalted code of moral principles, not only for the man and the warrior but for men and women in times both of peace and war.‚Äù  </p>

<p>That is it; that is it; I have it,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúIf my people are to be saved from national and racial death, they must be proved as if by fire‚Äîby the practice of a virile religion, not by following emasculated -sentimentalities which men shamelessly and slanderously identify with the holy One of God, His son, <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>.‚Äù</p>
                        </div>

<p>For the Rev. <span class="personal-name"> Silas Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> the die was cast. Passing from college to ordination without any fixed ideas as to his own relation to God in his son <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, or otherwise, and yielding to the advice of an old college chum,<span class="personal-name"> Kennedy Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>  by name, who at this time was holding the post of Political Officer on the Gold Coast, he had made up his mind to put in an application for the Colonial Chaplaincy at Sekondi rather than continue to face a life of penury as a curate in <span class="place-name-east-london"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London,_South_Africa" target="_blank">East London</a></span>
, particularly as he knew a friend or two who would work the back door influence beautifully with the officials at the Colonial Office on his behalf. </p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd what is the screw like,‚Äù eagerly asked  when<span class="personal-name"> Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> first made the suggestion to him. </p>


<p>‚ÄúOh, it is only a matter of some five hundred a year with an annual rise of twenty-five pounds, until you reach six hundred pounds, besides fees and allowances thrown in here and there, passages in and out free every twelve months, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, with an assistant chaplain a black man of course, to save you unnecessary drudgery.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúThat is quite good enough for me, minus the etceteras, and I am sure I thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving an inkling of such a billet. By George! how spoilt you Colonials are; and to think I was going to immure myself in East London for the rest of my natural life!"</p>

<p>But, remember,‚Äù put in<span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúyou will be subject to discipline. You must not, for example, join the silly band of ‚Äòprogressives,‚Äô or your chances of promotion will be absolutely nil, and you may even run the risk of being shelved altogether. The process of shelving is a simple one. You get down with fever; you are invalided home; you never return again, that is all.‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúYou needn‚Äôt fear about that. I have no proclivities that way, but tell me all about the progressives ‚Äô on the Gold Coast.‚Äù </p>

<p>Why, they are a mere handful of white fools who are blind enough not to see where their bread is buttered, and who advocate equal rights for the native, and all that sort of tommy rot. Now, between ourselves,‚Äù breaking out into a low mischievous laugh, ‚Äúthe Lieutenant-Governor him-self had progressive leanings when he first came out among us, and would not take the advice of us, old coasters. He seemed then as if he could dine off niggers, pardon a bit of Coast slang, until he was bitten, and bitten pretty sharply too, I can tell you. Now he sings the 'progressive' tune no longer,‚Äù laying particular emphasis on the last sentiment.</p>

<p>"But how was he bitten, and by whom?‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúBy <span class="term-fantis"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fante_people" target="_blank">the Fantis</a></span>
, of course. Didn‚Äôt you read in the papers at the time how he was hooted by the Fanti women in the central province? I was for bombarding their stronghold and sending the niggers flying all over the country, but the old bounder, the Permanent Secretary at the Colonial Office, who, by the way, is the one who really rules the roost, wouldn‚Äôt let-us. The thing is too bad, to think of niggers hooting a Lieutenant- Governor.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI confess, <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I cannot see the magnitude of the offence. I suppose there must have been something to hoot the good Governor for.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúOh, it was all about the Provincial Council question,‚Äù answered  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, wearily, as if struck by a sudden thought.  ‚ÄúI must be going home now. My little daughter will be all eagerness to welcome her papa. I came up to London to draw my pay, and meeting old coasters seems always to arouse the brute part of one somehow.‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚Äò‚ÄòHow do you mean,  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>?‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúSurely you must have a better account of your fellows than that.‚Äù</p>

<p> <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ignoring the thrust, said in a sad tone: ‚ÄúYou know, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, sometimes I cannot stand the funny little questions my little daughter puts to me when I return home from Africa. She has an idea that God has made of one blood all nations to dwell on the face of the earth‚Äîyou know the quotation; it is more in your line. I don‚Äôt know whence she got the notion, but, ‚Äòpapa,‚Äô she would jump on my knee, and looking me straight in the face with her delicate blue eyes, ‚Äòpapa,‚Äô she would begin, ‚ÄòI hope you were very good to those poor African people whom you have to look after. They say they are sometimes badly treated, but you will be kind to them, won‚Äôt you? ‚Äô When I am alone, I do think of these things, and my better self whispers to me that the child‚Äôs sentiments are right, and that they are directly contradictory to my line of official work.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúThere is a good deal in what you say. To be frank,  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I must say I cannot see, for instance, why sensible men should go into hysterics because a Lieutenant-Governor was hooted at. Why, I was at a meeting the other day at the Queen‚Äôs Hall when Mr.<span class="personal-name">Balfour</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was hissed at, and for a considerable length of time he could not get a hearing. I don‚Äôt remember the Hussars being called out to punish the naughty little band of British barbarians, as Grant Allen good-humouredly dubs us. And mind you he was the Prime Minister.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps that is the reasonable way of looking at the matter, but we all suffer from an affliction known as Coast conscience, and the powers save you, if you, as parson, should get a touch of it when you get out there. As for myself, I shall go quite crazy one of these days, if I don‚Äôt soon give up this job.‚Äù </p>

<p>In due course the Rev. <span class="personal-name"> Silas Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> received his appointment as Colonial Chaplain of Sekondi, nor did he find the emoluments of the office in any way exaggerated by his friend the Political Officer. His mother was satisfied, but to do the reverend gentleman justice, before sailing out, his own heart was full-of misgiving first as to his own spiritual condition, secondly as to whether he would have the moral courage, in the face of official stress, to do his duty as a man. A few months of coast life, however, soon settled all his doubts. Why should he worry about the matter of his spiritual condition. He was not the first clergyman who had been troubled with conscientious scruples. He would go through the ordinary routine of his work, land, when his term was ended, he would pack up his traps and go. Besides, it appeared that he had set too high an estimate upon the black character. The blacks, he had come to consider, were nothing but a pack of dishonest people, robbing white traders right and left, smuggling contraband goods, and defrauding His Majesty‚Äôs Government whenever they could. His duty as a Colonial Chaplain was plain. He must teach these people the elementary principles of honesty, thereby working hand in hand with His Majesty‚Äôs judges who had arrived at the same result. It was true there were a few exceptions among the educated class, but he was beginning to entertain doubts as to how to place even that class, and he was not at all sure how he would receive <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> even, whom he assured himself he had known just slightly in the ‚ÄôVarsity, if he happened to meet him on the Gold Coast. </p>

<p>The Assistant Colonial Chaplain was the Rev.<span class="personal-name">Kwaw Baidu</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, who drew an annual stipend of one hundred and fifty pounds. Besides doing the pastoral work along the railway line, including the management of a mission at <span class="place-name-tarkwa"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarkwa" target="_blank">Tarkwa</a></span>
, he had the bulk of the chaplaincy work thrown upon him, while the Chaplain himself was content to draw his fat pay and take things easy, as, he took care to explain, the medical officer had advised him to do as little as possible on account of the dreadful climate. Outside purely official duties, the Colonial Chaplain had nothing to do with his assistant, who was a highly cultured man, and, in some respects, his senior, having taken a better degree than the Chaplain. Not that the Chaplain was in any way unkind to the Assistant Chaplain. Oh, dear no! He only wished it to be mutually understood that between them was a natural gulf fixed ‚Äîthe gulf of a difference in their respective social status. So that if the twain happened to be at work together at the chaplaincy, and the Supervisor of Customs, let us say, called, he would politely say: ‚ÄúMr. Baidu, would you kindly excuse me, you will find the verandah cool and comfortable,‚Äù and would never venture upon an introduction. </p>

<p>The Rev. <span class="personal-name">Kwaw Baidu</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was an humble-minded man, and so long as the Colonial Chaplain did not come in conflict with him upon matters of principle, he did not mind. But, at last, an occasion for stumbling and a rock of offence arose in the shape of the segregation question. The town of <span class="place-name-akrokeri"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrokeri" target="_blank">Akrokeri</a></span>
 had been laid out into a European quarter immediately fronting the railway, and occupying the finest site the neighbourhood yielded, while the native chief and his people who by rights should own the whole surface, save such as was actually required for building purposes by the mines, had, with the connivance of the Government, been located on the steeps of a line of hills to the east, for which they had to pay quarterly rent. But when the question of building a cemetery for the interment of Akrokerites arose, and the European inhabitants put forward the view that on no account would they commingle their dead with the dead of ‚Äúniggers,‚Äù and the matter was by the Political Officer referred to the chaplaincy for opinion, the Rev.<span class="personal-name">Silas  Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> held that the Europeans were right, and the thing put the Rev. <span class="personal-name">Kwaw Baidu</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs back up. </p>

<p>‚ÄúDo you mean to say, you an ambassador of <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, that you are going to support any such nonsense as this which knocks the bottom out of all Christian charity? No wonder that the people turn a deaf ear to all my appeals. I will speak plainly to you for once. If you do not yield to reason and the spirit of Christ, whom you and I profess to follow, I will report your conduct to the Bishop, and, if need be, I will appeal to the <span class="place-name-archbishop-of-canterbury"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury" target="_blank">Archbishop of Canterbury</a></span>
.‚Äù</p>

<p> "You may do what you like, Mr. Baidu, but you seem to forget that this is a <span class="place-name-british-colony"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_colony" target="_blank">British Colony</a></span>
, and that the salaries of you and me are paid by the Colonial Government, and not by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Besides, I consider your opposition a piece of impertinence, and you must consider yourself suspended until I have recommended your dismissal to headquarters.‚Äù</p>

 <p>In due course the Rev. <span class="personal-name">Kwaw Baidu</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was compulsorily retired from the Colonial service, and a path, thirty-six feet wide, was marked between the European and native cemeteries, and the former beautifully fenced in with money mostly contributed by the black folk. But the matter got noised abroad, and there wasn‚Äôt a soul in the diocese of Sekondi that did not come to know of it.</p>


 2.
<p> A decrepit old woman, limping heavily on her crutches, made her way into the chaplaincy yard and insisted upon speaking to the white chaplain. The chaplaincy yard was kept scrupulously clean, and the little garden adjacent, with hybiscus and crotons growing in rich-profusion, and all bordered with festoons of sweet-peas and scarlet runners in early bloom, showed, as clearly as out- side appearances -went, that the Rev. <span class="personal-name"> Silas Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> fully appreciated the good things of life. The
Colonial Chaplain had dined well, and was enjoying a Havana under the spreading bread fruit trees which adorned the chaplaincy yard. The full moon threw a spray of silvery light through the myriad leaves of the overspreading branches, casting a halo over his face quite out of keeping with the mundane thoughts which at the moment engaged the mind of the reverend gentleman. </p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I believe in even an ambassador of Christ having a good time. Why should I be such a silly ass as to refuse whisky and soda at the Club?. Besides, we must be all things unto all men. That is clearly the scriptural admonition, and it suits my present humour down to the ground. So there goes it; it is done ‚Äù this as he flicked off the live ashes from his cigar. </p>


<p>A deep, low cough arrested the attention of the Rev. <span class="personal-name">Silas Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and he turned to see the direction whence it came. He had thought he was alone.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúWas it you, <span class="personal-name">Nancy</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>? ‚Äù he said, addressing the old woman. ‚ÄúWhat brings you here to-night?" The woman addressed curtsied low. She had been brought up in the mission school, finishing up in the High School, and spoke English with remarkable fluency. She had loved, and she had lost‚Äîfirst husband, then an only son who had been unto the husband as the apple of the eye, and, therefore, doubly dear unto her woman‚Äôs heart. Did I say lost? No, they were not lost. At least thus she had been taught by the missionaries, and 'when she was sad the chaplain had cheered her with the hope of the resurrection morn. She had come to believe that somewhere, in another sphere, they awaited her; and her one thought was that happy hour, one day, when they would welcome her to a place beside them. She lived for this and worked for this hope. Now and again, she thought she had glimpses of Him who said: "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life,‚Äù and she had been told the way to Him was to maintain the truth. A heavy burden, for some time back, had sorely pressed upon her heart, which she felt would be lifted by telling the Rev. <span class="personal-name"> Silas Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> the truth, as she conceived it; and so here she was to do it, and yet did not know how. </p>

<p>A soft wind rustled the luxuriant foliage overhead, and through the branches the bright stars peeped down upon this simple old woman whose only wish was -to-be in harmony with Nature‚Äôs God. A sudden inspiration, like the wind blowing where it listeth, came to her. She would tell the chaplain a story, as she had heard he was fond of Fanti stories, and was wont to collect them; and what better time than a moonlight night in Africa for telling stories? </p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Nancy</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> laid aside her crutches, took a low stool offered her by the Chaplain and cleared her throat of a troublesome cough or two ‚ÄúI have a nice story to tell you, sir, to add to your collection, and, as I was feeling a little stronger this evening than usual, I thought I would come in.‚Äù  </p>

<p>"Certainly, quite welcome,‚Äù said the Rev.<span class="personal-name"> Silas Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>.  ‚ÄúFire away, <span class="personal-name">Nancy</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; I am all eagerness to hear you begin.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúOnce upon a time,‚Äù <span class="personal-name">Nancy</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> began in a clear, sonorous voice, ‚Äúthere went into a far distant country two Mahomedan priests to work for Allah. After a time their paths lay in different districts, and they seldom heard of one another. As was their wont, the missionaries worked in leather and other useful industries; but, as it happened, <span class="personal-name">Akarbah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>  succeeded and grew rich in worldly goods, while <span class="personal-name">Adaku</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> , his friend, merely lived from hand to mouth; yet did Allah bless his labours.  As is the way of the world, <span class="personal-name">Akarbah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs society was now sought by the highest in the land; and when he counted his beads at the hour of prayer, he failed not to thank Allah for all the good He gave".</p>

<p>One day as he returned from the house of prayer he met an errand boy, who handed him a bit of parchment, written in Arabic. He opened it, and found it was a message from his brother missionary, who, he knew, was low and humble in the things of this world. ‚ÄòThis day,‚Äô so the message ran, ‚ÄòI, <span class="personal-name">Adaku</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, thy brother missionary, shall lodge with thee.‚Äô</p>

<p> "<span class="personal-name">Akarbah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> frowned. It was very inconvenient. This very day the High Sheriff was to dine with him, the rich and prosperous <span class="personal-name">Akarbah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and what would he say if he met at his table a mendicant friar of a Mahomedan priest? He was resolved. The thing must not be. ‚ÄòHere, lad, take this parchment back quickly to my brother <span class="personal-name">Adaku</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. Make sure and give it to him, and I will give you my blessing and a silver piece upon your return.‚Äô</p>

<p> ‚ÄúThe lad ran past the camels and the horses and the cattle in the market places, and went out by the fifth gate of the city to find the priest <span class="personal-name">Adaku</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was not at the place where he expected him to be. <span class="personal-name">Adaku</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had already entered by the seventh gate, and was already within the holy precincts of the abode of <span class="personal-name">Akarbah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚Äú ‚ÄòHail, brother,‚Äô was <span class="personal-name">Adaku</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs salutation. ‚ÄòMay Allah be ever more gracious to thee.‚Äô  </p>

<p>‚ÄúFor answer <span class="personal-name">Akarbah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> visibly trembled with agitation. ‚ÄòDid you not receive the parchment? <span class="personal-name">Adaku</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> stared vacantly at his friend. ‚ÄòWhat parchment? </p>

<p>‚Äú<span class="personal-name">Akarbah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> gave no answer, but suddenly left the precincts of his abode, as if struck by a sudden thought. The hours passed, but they did not bring <span class="personal-name">Akarbah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. At last the truth dawned upon <span class="personal-name">Adaku</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄòEvidently I am not wanted here,‚Äô and, putting on his sandals and snatching his staff, he passed out of the house of his friend, shaking the dust off his feet as he did so, and never forgetting to mention him, not in anger, it is said, when he counted his beads in the house of Allah.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat a funny story, <span class="personal-name">Nancy</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; whatever do you mean? ‚Äù said the Rev. <span class="personal-name"> Silas Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, as the old woman finished what she had to say.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, it is funny,‚Äù she said; ‚Äúbut you know, chaplain, I have lately had such grave doubts as I to whether what you tell us in those beautiful sermons you read out every Sunday about the love of God, of heaven, and the rest of it can all be true; and oh! whatever shall I do after all these years of weary waiting, if they are not true? Where is my husband, and where my son?‚Äù and it was painful to see the distress and the anguish in the face of the poor woman. </p>

<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go on like that, <span class="personal-name">Nancy</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. But what is there to make you doubt of heaven and the love of God? ‚Äù</p>

<p>The old woman dried a tear or two, and said very slowly and deliberately:</p>

<p> ‚ÄúChaplain, you asked me when I had done telling my story what I meant by it. I have prayed to God night and day for some time to be able to answer that self-same question when it came, and now, God helping me, I will. Know thou, then, that thou art the <span class="personal-name">Akarbah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> ----- hath exalted you above thy fellows that thou mightest be a guide unto us his forlorn little ones, and show us the way of love and t' vav to heaven. But surely thou hast not dealt in love with thy brother,<span class="personal-name">Kwaw Baidu</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, who is now out of work, with wife and children depending upon him, whose story is known to all the parishioners for miles and miles around. And oh ! if the heaven you have so often preached about hath two ways leading to it, one for us black folk and one for you our masters, what an undesirable place it must be for us after all the I weariness here below. But do tell me‚Äîyou who have raised the hope in me‚Äîwhere is now my husband, and where my child? " ejaculated the poor woman, wringing her hands. ‚ÄúTell me, for thou hast helped to raise false hopes in me. Oh, God ! What shall I do?‚Äù And the poor woman swooned away dead faint. Every effort was made to revive her, without success, and when the doctor arrived he pronounced life extinct. </p>

                            <p>It was Empire Day‚Äîthe 24th of May‚Äîthe day on which was commemorated throughout the Empire the birth of the great white Queen who, in her life, surrounded the <span class="place-name-british-throne"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_monarchy" target="_blank">British throne</a></span>
 with a halo of womanly virtues, the kind of thing before which, in all ages and in all climes, the heart of universal man bows low in reverential homage and respect.</p>
                          <p>The Gold Coast is also a component part of the British Empire‚Äîas necessary to the complete whole as the smallest link to the complete chain; and so, as the women trooped out this morning in their hundreds in Ethiopian costumes with their hair done up in the most graceful, yet picturesque, fashions, and the children with bunting and palms and flowers, all gay and merry as for a wedding feast, one could easily realise that the heart of the people was true. What could not be made of material such as this‚Äîthe nucleus of the free Ethiopian Empire that is to be? </p>

<p>Why had they thus turned out? What meaning had ‚ÄúEmpire Day " for these simple folk?</p>

 <p>All they knew was that the great white Queen, the great Awuraba, or mistress, whose son now reigned over them, had been born on this day, and her they delighted to honour; but if you asked them wherefore they loved and cherished her memory, they could not tell you why. Perhaps it was an instinctive feeling that she, a good woman, could never be unkind to them and their people, and sympathy had begotten loyalty. After she was gone, they familiarly referred to her, and said : ‚ÄúInde Awuraba niba adzi adzi, wo ma ye nkoko sumunu‚Äù that was to say, ‚ÄúNow our mistress‚Äôs son reigns; let us go and serve him.‚Äù </p>

<p>It was a day to be remembered by the merchant, because he lost money by the closure of his factory; by the official, because it gave him a day off and extra drinks; by the school children, be- cause they came in for a treat gratuitously supplied by the simple folk of the community, as a kind of offering to the great white throne. And so it happened that all had enjoyed themselves and made merry.</p>

<p> By  <span class="personal-name"> Kenny Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> this day of days had been spent in looking over the District Record Book for the past six months during which he had been away on furlough. He was to take charge on the morrow, as his assistant was due for leave. But the more he read the more furious did he become. Things had not altogether gone to his liking. It was late in the afternoon; the day had been sultry; and he, faithful servant of the King, had worked late and long. Suddenly, turning round to his orderly: ‚ÄúKwesi,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúrun fast, fast, to Mr. <span class="personal-name"> Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> and tell him I want him here one time.‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúYes, Sar!‚Äù and, in a moment, Kwesi was racing down the main street in the direction of the parade ground. </p>

<p>‚ÄúMaser want you, Sar!,‚Äù said Kwesi to <span class="personal-name"> Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, who was enjoying himself immensely in his own fashion.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúAnd what on earth does ‚Äòmaser ‚Äô want with me on a day like this? Say to ‚Äòmaser‚Äô I dey come.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúTut! tut! tut! whatever good are you for, I should like to know,‚Äù said Political Officer  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> to his assistant,  <span class="personal-name"> David Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, as in return to a low respectful bow, he merely glanced <span class="personal-name"> Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs way in a half nod, half menace. ‚ÄúThe fact is,‚Äù he pursued, ‚Äú you are too d‚Äîm straight for the Gold Coast Diplomatic Service. It is like you <span class="place-name-scotch-people"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scotch people</a></span>
, you are always putting your confounded conscience before obvious duty. Here you have gone and spoilt a whole eighteen months of strenuous work on my part to put into operation in Insima District the policy mapped out by the Lieutenant-Governor.‚Äù </p>

<p><span class="personal-name"> David Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>was somewhat taken aback at this sort of reception, and, at first, did not know whether to put it down to the extra rise in the thermometer, extra whiskies and sodas, or to his ill luck in being born with a conscience. Truth to tell, <span class="personal-name"> David Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was a typical Scotchman, as straight as a die, and had already gained for himself among the Africans the sobriquet of ‚Äúhonest David.‚Äù Reflecting a moment, David said, ‚ÄúExcuse me, sir, but I don‚Äôt know in the least what you are talking about. Perhaps if you took the matter calmly, I can understand you better. In the meanwhile, let me warn you, sir,‚Äù his Scotch blood for the nonce getting the better of him, ‚Äúthat much as I respect you, I shall seriously resent the next rash reference you make to my people.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd what on earth do you mean by allowing that impudent rascal <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> to sneak into this district?‚Äù angrily demanded  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and ignoring <span class="personal-name"> Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs remonstrance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have our hands full, I can assure you, and you will have to answer for it at headquarters. But whether or not, I won‚Äôt have you in this district, do you hear? I‚Äôll recommend you for leave at once, and when you return, if you ever do, you may go to <span class="place-name-kintampor"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintampo" target="_blank">Kintampor</a></span>
, or some hotter place, for aught I care.‚Äù
 "How absurd you are this evening, Mr.  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, to be sure! How could I prevent <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> coming into the district to practise? Besides is a native of the country; the chiefs look up him; and I had always understood we were to reason through the chiefs, and, by parity of reasons through their natural leaders.‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúDo you call it sound policy to play into the hands of a man who can write such rubbish as <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> does? ‚Äù throwing heavily upon the table a thick volume which had been standing' the dirty shelf. ‚ÄúPray listen to this and tell1 whether your senses have fled,‚Äù this as he read from the open page the following: ‚Äú‚ÄòWere there such a thing as political ethics, or a pretence semblance thereof among Christian nations, there is a semblance of some sort of Christian!! in so-called Christian countries, it might be permissible to inquire how far the conduct of Christian nations in relation to aboriginal races, sometimes charitably called subject races, conformed the Christian standard of morality‚Äî' Now that is rank heresy, teaching the aboriginals that are a parcel of hypocrites and cut-throats; and W think that the writer of this vile stuff has been Id in here through your stupidity!‚Äù pursued <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> breathlessly.</p>

 <p><span class="personal-name"> Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> made a move as if to knock the Politics Officer down; but just then a voice from the verandah attracted his attention, and, in a twinkling, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had placed himself between the two. </p>

<p>‚ÄúThere is no reason,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, "why you two gentlemen should not repair to the back yard and have it out in true sportsmanlike fashion. But as for expressing your opinions of one another freely in the hearing of the black boys, I don‚Äôt know what to say of it. By George! how they swarmed at the foot of the stairs, peeping one behind the other, until I kicked them off the premises as I came up. Besides, we did the thing differently in my youthful days. Fewer words, you know; but, perhaps, the heat had something to do with it, or I mightn‚Äôt have had the trouble of interfering,‚Äù placing himself in pugilistic attitude first towards  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and then towards <span class="personal-name"> Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. The situation was fast bordering on the ridiculous, and as <span class="personal-name"> Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was in no mood for fun, he snatched up his hat, bowed low, and in a moment he was gone.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúB‚Äîoy! b‚Äîoy! cocktails, two cocktails, do you hear? and look sharp about it, or by Jove, I will break every bone in your body!‚Äù Then turning to <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äî‚ÄúThe idea of these boys always hanging round and eavesdropping. The worst of it is one can‚Äôt do without them.‚Äù </p>

<p>When the servant had placed the drinks on the table and departed, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> said: ‚ÄúI would advise you,  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, to be careful what you say in the hearing of these native boys of the man <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. You have no idea what a hold he has upon the popular imagination, and how wide spread is his influence. Personally, there is something irresistible about him I could never withstand. I knew him in my student days. Under normal conditions, I should say it is the charm of a manly purpose and force of character. But, then, no one is normal in these parts." And there was a strange sadness in his voice which  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> could not help noticing from the way he laid stress on the words ‚Äúno one.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúMind you don‚Äôt miss the Chief Magistrate‚Äôs dinner, or he‚Äôll never forgive you; the hour is 8 p.m.,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, as he slowly descended the stairs. </p>

<p>As for <span class="personal-name"> Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, he could not help turning over in his mind the strange medley which was labelled the Gold Coast Diplomatic Service. He remembered reading somewhere before coming out the following: <i>‚Äúit must strike the careful observer that the position of a man in the public service of the Gold Coast is often a difficult one. If such a man is honest and intelligent, he cannot fail soon to discover the peculiar conditions under which he is called upon to discharge his duties. The first thing that will occur to him will be the dog- in-the-manger.. policy of the Administration, ''whose servant he is. He will find that, theoretically, the people are free, having their I own laws and institutions. He will see that the Government, apparently, recognise this fact; but that in practice, he, the public servant, is expected to interfere with the institutions of the people as far as he dares. Neither is he told to allow the natural development of the institutions of the people, nor is he directed, in so many words, to attempt to mould them. What he does to-day, which is considered wrong by his superiors, may be done tomorrow by another and applauded.‚Äù</i> As he put two and two together, trying to fathom the real cause of his superior officer‚Äôs annoyance, the truth gradually dawned upon him. He had acted bv the natives as an honest man should do. During the time he had acted as the head of the Diplomatic Service he had given the chiefs every encouragement to unite with one another and to consolidate their authority and jurisdiction over their people. He had encouraged national schools throughout the district, and supported the Chiefs to make bye-laws, requiring every child to attend the schools until the age of fourteen. All these were in the line of normal and healthy growth of the people in enlightened progressive ways, and he had worked with a will and a great deal of intelligence and tact. It had never dawned upon him that there was a theoretical policy and a practical one, the latter having as its aim such a shaping of circumstances as would forever make the Ethiopian in his own country a hewer of wood and a drawer of water unto his Caucasian protector and so-called friend.
  This then was what he was expected to do. Was it right, could he conscientiously do it? </p>

                            <p> A SPLENDID repast, in the course of which good spirits and good cheer had flowed freely. The talk had varied from <span class="place-name-oxford-dons"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University" target="_blank">Oxford dons</a></span>

; and when it came down to liqueur and coffee everyone was merry, but truly the merriest was the genial host, and a right down good sort he was. </p>

<p>The Chief Magistrate beat himself this evening, and as he waxed more and more eloquent and glibly passed on from one subject to the other, it was only right that the eternal race question should come in for a fair consideration. </p>

<p>They were a body of learned men, the guests of the evening, including the members of the Diplomatic Service, one or two doctors, with a fair sprinkling of coloured barristers, and, as it became such a company, they talked learnedly. </p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen you come to talk of the jurisdiction of the native Kings and Chiefs I lose all patience with you,‚Äù said the host, as he wheeled round upon a youthful barrister who had ventured to make an observation upon the destoolment, that is to say, the deposition of the Chief of Agona. ‚ÄúThe King of England is King here, and it is ridiculous to think that these little squirts of puppet headmen can be said to have jurisdiction‚Äù.</p>

<p><span class="personal-name"> Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> of the Diplomatic Service rashly came to the rescue of the youthful barrister. ‚Äú I " thought I had seen such a thing as a Native Jurisdiction Ordinance in the Corpus Juris of the Gold Coast.‚Äù </p>

<p>The host growled and told him plainly, but politely, without much ado, that he knew next to nothing about the matter. Turning to <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, he pursued, ‚ÄúNow, what do you think‚Äî you go up country, and one day one of your puppet kings sends and arrests you and claps you in gaol --how would you feel over the matter, eh?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAt the best of times, I confess,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúit is not pleasant to find oneself in durance vile. But if the jurisdiction is there, what is there to do but to submit to it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat is exactly what you needn‚Äôt do. When one of your native authorities comes before me with their confounded jurisdiction notions I treat them as little children, and dismiss the whole thing with a jest. I can assure you, it is a most effective way. Besides, talking seriously, you have not considered the effect of the Order in Council.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúWhich Order in Council do you mean? ‚Äù ventured a precocious full-fledged. ‚ÄúWhat else can I mean but the last, which defined the limits of the colony, and vested the jurisdiction in our sovereign Lord the King,‚Äù almost shrieked out the host. </p>

<p>‚ÄúMy dear sir,‚Äù put in <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúif I may venture to come to the assistance of my young friend, it takes two to make a bargain, as you will find if you examine into the constitutional history of the country.‚Äù </p>

<p>For the moment the host was nonplussed. He was somewhat hazy as to the historical part of the subject. But as a parting shell, he exclaimed: ‚Äù Well, be that as it may, it was one of your own men who drew a report upon this very matter upon which the Government have acted. I have seen it f with my own eyes, I assure you, and I make you a present of the fact.‚Äù</p>

<p> I say, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>,‚Äù continued the Chief Magistrate, ‚Äúhow did you get on with that cemetery  controversy of yours ? I hear you have given your assistant the sack. I say, it is really too bad of you. I am strong on so-called native jurisdiction, and that kind of thing, but when it conies to segregation of the dead, I tell you the thing beats me. Think of old Lawson, the pioneer of the gold industry, not receiving decent interment on the ground of colour. The thing is preposterous, and I am not in sympathy with it.‚Äù <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> coloured up and appeared confused. The criticism was sharp and unexpected. </p>

<p>The Chief Magistrate was known for his frank expression of opinion, no matter what the subject matter of discussion was.  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> thought it was time he came to the rescue of the Government policy. </p>

<p>‚ÄúBravo! Chief, I like your fine speech,‚Äù addressing the Chief Magistrate. ‚Äú I never knew you were a champion of the non-segregation theory. At the next sitting of the Council I shall not fail to record the considered views of such a highly placed official as your Honour.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI have never been able to understand the argument in favour of segregation,‚Äù put in the conscientious <span class="personal-name"> Macan</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> unguardedly. ‚ÄúIn the time of an epidemic, for instance, I can understand why the afflicted, without distinction, should be put away. But in normal times, to be sure, I don‚Äôt understand the philosophy of the matter.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúThe question has nothing to do with epidemics. The man in the street knows that,‚Äù sourly retorted  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúBesides, it is common knowledge that whites never catch small-pox from blacks,‚Äù he added irrelevantly.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúHa! ha! ha! ha!‚Äù" burst out Dr.<span class="personal-name">Castor</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good, go one further. In all my experience I declare!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mean to insult me, doctor, I hope. Besides, all this discussion before these gentlemen,‚Äù waving his hand in the direction of the <span class="term-coloured"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloureds" target="_blank">coloured</a></span>
 fraternity, ‚Äúis most unseemly, and I for one must beg leave to retire.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúPray, don‚Äôt go away, Mr.  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúI am sure we are not offended in the slightest. My friends here, like myself, are used to this kind of thing. But what are the odds ? I, for one, am strong on <i>reciprocity.‚Äù</i> </p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd what has reciprocity to do with this matter? ‚Äù angrily demanded the Political Officer. </p>

<p>‚ÄúOnly this, sir,‚Äù began <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> calmly, ‚Äúthat if you took mankind in the aggregate,
irrespective of race, and shook them up together, as you would the slips of paper in a jury panel box, you would find after the exercise that the cultured would shake themselves free and come together, and so would the uncouth, the vulgar, and the ignorant; but, of course, you would ignore this law of nature, and, with a wave of the hand, confine the races in separate air-tight compartments. Wherefore I preach <i>reciprocity.‚Äù</i> </p>

<p>‚ÄúI say, you fellows, we must be going; it is getting late ‚Äù‚Äîthis said the senior member of the legal fraternity as he rose, turban in hand, to take leave of the genial host, who was fuming at  <span class="personal-name">Bilcox</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs rudeness. ‚ÄúGood-night, sir, we thank you so much for kind entertainment,‚Äù he continued, addressing the Chief Magistrate. </p>

<p>‚ÄúGood-night, gentlemen.‚Äù</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>THE political wisdom of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> the son of <span class="personal-name">Ekra Kwow</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, was learnt at the feet of his father while yet he was in his teens. Being a lad of inquiring mind and quick perception, many a curious question did he put to his father on odd occasions, when <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> would return answers full of pith and marrow.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of the ‚Äúyellow peril‚Äô?‚Äù interrogated the precocious youth, as he maned his neck behind the chair of the <span class="term-paterfamilias"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pater_familias" target="_blank">paterfamilias</a></span>
, who was leisurely gleaning from the pages of <i>Public Opinion</i>.</p>

 <p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> raised his eyes from the printed matter, and beckoned the young hopeful forward. Eyeing the lad curiously, he said, ‚ÄúIf you must know, I suppose I must give you the lesson, and, perhaps, the earlier the better. Now, if you should be going to school tomorrow, and at the street corner <span class="personal-name">Kweku Mensah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> knocked off your cap and punched your nose, what would you do?</p>

<p>‚ÄúI would, of course, punch his head back,‚Äù answered the lad triumphantly. ‚ÄúGood! Now let us go a step further. Suppose your school fellows were going on a picnic, and Kobina Tsintsin‚Äôs boys met you on the public road and barred your progress, would not you brave lads fight your way through? "</p>

<p> ‚ÄúOf course, dad, what else could we do in honour of our school?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNow, for the application. In geography books you have learnt that different nations dwell on the face of the earth‚Äîwhite, yellow, red, brown and black like ourselves. They each occupy a portion of the earth‚Äôs surface. Those who occupy those tiny islands somewhere in the English Channel are, as you know, called the English. So you have the Japanese, those brave fellows, the Indians, the Africans, or to come down to particulars, among the Africans, say, <span class="term-zulus"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_people" target="_blank">the Zulus</a></span>
, <span class="term-ashantis"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_people" target="_blank">the Ashantis</a></span>
, and the Fantis. To give the principle which made you punch <span class="personal-name">Kweku Mensah</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> back, and your school fellows bravely break through the ranks of Kobina Tsintsin‚Äôs boys, a name, let us call it the law of self-preservation. Now, if you relax the practice of this principle in the course of life, you go under, and men then talk of the survivors as the fittest, because they have resisted best. You remember those lines in Shakespeare you were reciting to me the other day: </p>

	<p>Beware </p>
<p>Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, </p>
<p>Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee‚Äî' </p>

<p>That is a wholesome rule of life, my boy. Well,‚Äù pursued <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúthere are certain nations in the world who call themselves Christians, and who claim a monopoly of culture, knowledge and civilisation, and who, <i>ergo</i>, think that they have a heaven-born right to survive and thrive while all others go under. They are mostly whites, and when either the brown, or the yellow, or the black man resists and shows he does not mean to go under, these self-same white Christian people hysterically cry out: ‚ÄòThe Yellow Peril,‚Äô or the ‚ÄòBlack Peril,‚Äô as the case may be. Do you understand, my lad? ‚Äù laying his hand slowly on the child‚Äôs head, and looking him straight in the face, so that the child‚Äôs eyes met the father‚Äôs fully and meaningly. </p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I do, dad,‚Äù replied the lad. ‚ÄúBut tell me, dad, I did not wish to interrupt you before‚Äî why did you call the Japs, ‚Äòthose brave fellows?‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy, simply because in the present contest they are engaged in with Russia, they have shown they do not mean to go under, whoever else may do so; and they have caused the cry of ‚Äò the yellow peril of late to go up more hysterically than ever. Listen to this rare bit,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, reaching for his scrap album and turning to the letter J : The sacred duty is incumbent upon us, as the leading state of Asiatic progress to stretch a helping hand to <span class="term-china"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" target="_blank">China</a></span>
, <span class="term-india"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" target="_blank">India</a></span>
, and <span class="term-korea"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea" target="_blank">Korea</a></span>
, to all <span class="term-asiatics"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people" target="_blank">the Asiatics</a></span>
 who have confidence in us, and who are capable of civilisation. As their more powerful friend, we desire them all to be free from the yoke which Europe has placed upon them, and that they may hereby prove to the world that <span class="term-orient"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient" target="_blank">the Orient</a></span>
is capable of measuring swords with the Occident on any field of battle.‚Äù These words were spoken in the <span class="term-japanese-house-of-peers"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peers_(Japan)" target="_blank">Japanese House of Peers</a></span>
, and they embody the principle I have been trying to inculcate upon you in a nutshell. You will do well to remember them all your life; and since I find you an apt pupil likely to pass the lessons on to others after I am gone, I will tell you of my experiences with the Political Officer.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúBut what is a Political Officer? ‚Äù queried the stripling.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúThere you are again with your inquiring little brain. I must begin from premises to conclusion, step by step, like the <i>quod erat demonstrandum </i>you were worrying me with the other day. Still you are right, my boy. Once define clearly, and all difficulties vanish, as mist before the noon-day sun. Well, the system of Government under which we, the people of the Gold Coast, live is known as the ‚Äò<span class="term-crown-colony-system"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_colony" target="_blank">Crown Colony system</a></span>
.‚Äô It is a system somewhat behind the times. Now, what would you boys think of your schoolmaster in these enlightened days if he should, from time to time, ask you to contribute out of your pocket money funds for the	laying out of a recreation ground without allowing some of you boys to have a say as to how things were to be done, and what games were to be bought for the school ? I am sure you would all revolt and say, ‚ÄòIf you are going to use our money, you might at least let us say what games we would like.‚Äô Under the system I am telling you of the schoolmaster is the <span class="term-governor"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor" target="_blank">Governor</a></span>
, and the lads are the people of this country whose contributions are in the shape of the heavy duties they pay on all imported articles. But they have no voice in the spending of their contributions, and that is why I say the system is somewhat behind the times. To proceed, seeing there must be discontent among the people, the Political Officer is the man appointed to deal with cases arising out of such discontent.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúBut how? I don‚Äôt quite understand, dad. Does he go and speak kindly to the people and tell them not to mind and that they will have the value of their contributions, if they are patient? ‚Äù <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> burst out hilariously, and for some minutes could not control himself. The lad began to feel sheepish, and thought he must have said something very odd. But, presently <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> came to, and a look of sadness seemed to play upon his countenance as slowly he murmured to himself the words :</p>
<p> 'And its heart as pure as now.‚Äô </p>

<p>Quick as thought, memory had flashed back that unique chapter in his life‚Äôs experience when she and he had watched over this very child in infant slumbers, bone of their bone, flesh of their flesh, and in the fulness of their hearts the prayer had gone up:</p>

 <p>"That when time‚Äôs mystic fingers wrote manhood </p>
<p>on its brow,</p>
 <p>It‚Äôs deeds might be as gentle and its heart as</p>
<p> pure as now.‚Äù </p>

<p>And now, he was left alone to help realise that prayer in the youthful enquirer. Mastering his feelings, and, for the moment rolling a stone over the sepulchre of the ever virgin past, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> turned to his son, and drawing him closely to his heart, spoke gently thus: ‚Äú How I wish I could keep you, my boy, from knowing the seamy side of life. But since knowledge must come some day, it were well I guided thee to the sources thereof, if so be it might not be all gall to thy thirsty soul.‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúNo, the Political Officer does not exactly do what one should think, my boy. Here on the "Gold Coast the people have also shown that they do not mean to go under, but in a different way. You know the story of the wolf and the lamb. I see you are all eagerness. Well, it will bear repetition. The wolf meets the lamb on a thirsty day by a stream. The wolf stands higher up the stream and drinks, while the lamb quenches its thirst in the lower part. Presently Mr. Wolf says to Master Lamb, ‚Äòwhat do you mean by making the stream muddy? ‚Äô ‚Äò How can that be ? ' says Master Lamb, ‚Äòsince you are higher up the stream than I am.‚Äô ‚ÄòI hear you spoke disrespectfully of me three months ago,‚Äô puts in Mr. Wolf. Master Lamb meekly: ‚ÄòI have been in the world only two months gone.‚Äô ‚ÄòWell, if it wasn‚Äôt you,‚Äô replies the wolf, ‚Äòit must have been your father who did.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúCoward!‚Äù ‚Äúcried <span class="personal-name">Ekra Kwow</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, excitedly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt I wish I were close by with my little pop gun? I should have put a hole through Mr. Wolf right enough.‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúGood, my boy, that‚Äôs well said. But, unfortunately, it is an every day occurrence in this world, and, what is worse, we can‚Äôt always bring to play our pop guns when we may morally be justified in doing so.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúBut it is high time you were in bed. Another time, if you are good, I will tell you all about the Political Officer, and my experiences with him, if you remind me how far we have come to-day.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood-night, dad!‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúGood-night, my boy,‚Äù and, in a minute, he bad disappeared behind the curtains, leaving <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> to his thoughts and to his pipe. </p>

                            <p>HERE, on the Gold Coast, the people have shown that they do not mean to go under, but in a different way‚Äî ‚Äù this, as the precocious youth produced a sheet-of paper with the words neatly written down ‚Äú I meant not to forfeit the rest of the story you see, dad, and now for your promise please," drawing a low seat close to the paternal chair.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúI see you have forgotten the illustration but not the text, and as other illustrations are easy to find," said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚ÄúI shall redeem my promise. They are scattered over the pages of history. In your historical lessons you have undoubtedly heard of what is called the ‚ÄòEastern Question?‚Äô"	</p>

<p> ‚ÄúYes, I have, though I forget what it was exactly, and, besides, I learn these things better when you tell them to me your way, dad," said the lad excitedly. ‚ÄúNow, if you will compose yourself, and absolution in the other to snatch away the patrimony of others : </p>

<p>'Why should they live‚ÄîFate has writ large its doom for them.</p>
  <p>Laud for the whites! Let the black fellows die ! ‚Äô the European nations seem to shout, and reck not offence to God or man in the cry.‚Äù </p>
<p>‚ÄúBut how does all this apply to our country? ‚Äù asked <span class="personal-name">Ekra Kwow</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúHow does it ?‚Äîgood ! I like to think you are following so closely what the learned books call the argument, that is, the immediate subject under discussion. Well, I will tell you in one word. The Political Officer represents the self-assertive-ness of the English in extending power and authority at every nook and corner wherever the thin end of the wedge can be introduced. The sagacious black man offers a point of resistance when he pleads his peculiar customs and institutions, and presto! the cry of the ‚Äòeducated native peril‚Äô is raised, as if forsooth, the ‚Äònative‚Äô ceases to be a ‚Äò native ‚Äô the moment he is educated. The genuine cry might be ‚Äòthe black peril,‚Äô but that won‚Äôt do at present. The wolf and the lamb story again, you see.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúBut why don‚Äôt you expose these things, dad? You can write, you can talk, why don‚Äôt you let the whole world know of them,‚Äù said the lad with some degree of beat.<p>

<p>‚ÄúNot so fast, my boy,‚Äù said Kwamani laying his hand on the child‚Äôs head, and speak slowly and deliberately, as was his wont w about to give vent to some utterance from the recesses of his soul. ‚ÄúI wish you to understand my dear child, that it is neither the anger of powerful, nor the hope of favour from the .... that has hitherto sealed my lips. I have taught you from your infancy to regard truth as highest of all virtues, as the apex of character and he who falls in declaring the truth in his d and generation, is but a humble follower of <span class="term-socrates"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates" target="_blank">Socrates</a></span>
, or if you prefer it, of the Nazarene. try to follow his example, prepared to suffer needs be in the cause of country, race, and humanity,‚Äù and drawing the child nearer, added in suppressed tones‚Äî‚Äúonly the hour is not yet come.

                            <p>‚ÄúI say, boys, what class are you travelling,‚Äù shouted Aban to Tandor-Kuma and <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. </p>

<p>‚ÄúI go neither first nor second,‚Äù returned Tandor-Kuma; and as the Gold Coast Government Railway boasts of only two classes, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> said, ‚ÄúLook here, you fellows, I am a man of peace. If you are going to have any larks, I would rather take the down train twenty-four hours hence.‚Äù </p>

<p>By this time the bell announcing the hour for the departure of the train had sounded. So <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> rushed to secure a first-class ticket, leaving the ‚ÄúProfessor ‚Äù and Tandor-Kuma to their own devices. When he returned, the two had occupied seats in the first-class compartment and started to make themselves merry with the good things which <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had provided for the journey. </p>

<p>‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to you and another five hundred a year, as the chaps over the water say ‚Äù‚Äîthis as the ‚Äú Professor‚Äù raised his glass in the direction of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. Seeing there was no alternative,  the latter resigned himself to the situation and good-humouredly toasted the company round. </p>

<p>‚ÄúTeekets! teekeets!‚Äù shouted the collector from the second-class end of the ‚Äúcomposite carriage.‚Äù Of course, you know what a ‚Äúcomposite carriage ‚Äù is? If you don‚Äôt, I will enlighten you. It is the kind of thing on this particular railway in which the whites' travel at one end, their servants and the black E1ite at the other end, while the ordinary blacks are packed like sardines in a detached carriage, labelled ‚Äúsecond-class.‚Äù Not that there is any rule prohibiting black gentlemen from using a first-class carriage, but the fact is the class referred to know better, and have too much self-respect to travel first, except on rare occasions when they can have a carriage all to themselves. </p>

<p>To resume, ‚Äúteekeets! teekeets!‚Äù sounded nearer. By this time the ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù was in the middle of a Mississippi story, and his brush with buffaloes and other hair-breadth escapes. After taking a cheap degree, with his usual erratic disposition, Adran had been travelling, often supporting himself by odd jobs, and had included in his experiences an acquaintance with the Japs of whom he was never tired of speaking. The ticket collector eyed the three black gentlemen furtively once or twice, and seemed to have come to a mental resolve not to disturb them for the nonce, nor did the trio disturb him by so much as a momentary notice of his presence. </p>

<p>Just as he was about retreating to the second class compartment, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> shouted after him, ‚Äú I say, collector, won‚Äôt you have a drink? " holding out to him some whisky and soda‚Äî‚Äú the others do it, you know,‚Äù and this with a knowing wink. </p>

<p>The collector was human. He hesitated, then made up his mind, took the drink, and went away. Presently he returned and became communicative. </p>
<p>‚ÄúI don't know, Sar, if any of you, be lawyer man, Sar? ‚Äù </p>
<p>Tandor-Kuma chuckled. ‚ÄúWhat next,‚Äù demanded the ‚ÄúProfessor ‚Äù sternly. <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> held his peace, appearing not to listen. </p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Sar, but I bin tink say I da go show you di rules which say di collector mus examin ebery gentman him teekeet.‚Äù</p>
<p> <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> began to fumble in his pockets.</p>
<p> ‚ÄúMy good man,‚Äù said the ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù to the collector, ‚Äú I have made it a rule never to give up my ticket on <i></i>this<p> line till I have landed safely at my destination, do you understand?‚Äù </p>

<p>The emphasis seemed to upset the equilibrium of the collector. He sneaked away, may be, to reflect upon the advantage of an emphasis, and sure enough, he was soon heard letting off steam in the second-class compartment at the expense of an inoffensive Fanti. </p>

<p>By this time the train had passed Mansu. Shortly after leaving that station there was some trouble with one of the vans getting off the rails: and it was a matter of half-an hour it was set right. Half-way between Mansu and Ashieme, some timber was taken, and as they steamed away in the twilight, the train with its composite appendages was a full furlong long! Soon they were in thick darkness. </p>

<p>‚ÄúLight, collector, light!‚Äù‚Äîthis from <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, for in the detached carriage could be heard yells and shrieks of women and children. </p>

<p>‚ÄúI say, collector, light! Do you hear? Light! ‚Äù and this with an expletive or two from the ‚ÄúProfessor.‚Äù The expletive did its work. The collector made his way to the composite carriage amid a scene of much confusion. </p>

<p>‚ÄúYou had better go and fetch the Inspector to see about this mess, or I will report the whole lot of you fellows, white and black alike. It is perfectly disgraceful, this kind of thing,‚Äù said Tandor-Kuma. </p>

<p>The Inspector, who had, in the meantime, been hurried to the detached compartment by the shrieks of the women and children, had by this time got into the composite carriage. ‚Äú What the deuce are you doing not having yet lighted the carriage,‚Äù he said to the collector with an offended air. </p>

<p>‚ÄúI no get mach. Sar! Railway no buy me mach, Sar! </p>

<p>The Inspector made as if he would knock the collector down, but thought better of the matter, and, snatching a borrowed match box, quickly tried to light the lamp. Puff! went out the light. </p>

<p>Try again, Sir,‚Äù suggested <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> dryly. ‚ÄúThere may be a drop of water in the oil.‚Äù Puff! went out the light the second time. ‚ÄúTry again! try again!‚Äù came from all sides. ‚ÄúShall I get out and buy you some paraffin, Mr. Inspector? You know this is perfectly disgraceful. Thirteen shillings for thirty-nine miles and no oil,‚Äù said Tandor-Kuma.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTry again! try again! knock him down, teach him a lesson,‚Äù shouted some roughs. It was getting a bit exciting. The Inspector beat a hasty retreat. ‚ÄúThey call dis di Govmont railway. It is di dirtiest hole I-have been in South Africa, East Africa, North Africa, they be countries. Dis country is disgraceful to the British Govmont,‚Äù put in a Frenchman at the corner. </p>

<p>Pu! pu! pu ! piyu ! ! Pu ! pu ! piyu'!! came the heartbreaking snort from the nostrils of the iron horse. It reminded one of an overworked omnibus horse at midnight in Oxford Street. First back- wards, then downwards, up the incline, and down the gradient, toyed the iron horse, and as Tandor-Kuma thought of his wife and children waiting dinner in the cosy little room across the bridge, he could not help inwardly bestowing a blessing upon the devil and all his works. It was not until 9.30 p.m. that the terminus was made, the party having left on their 39 miles run at 2.30 p.m. As the trio walked the lonely streets, where black men are scarcely seen after sunset, the Professor, as a parting reminder, said to <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äú On principle I never pay for a ticket on this line until I have made the terminus, and if you are a wise man, you will take my tip.‚Äù</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>TOM PALMER, the son of Jonathan Palmer, of Horse Road, Ussher Town, Accra, was a goodly youth of many fine qualities. The Palmers originally hailed from <span class="term-sierra-leone"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone" target="_blank">Sierra Leone</a></span>
, settling on the Gold Coast early in the fifties of the last century. By dint of great energy, combined with uncommon business tact, the first Palmer had gradually won for himself a competence which the second Palmer, with equal tact, had gone on improving, so that when it came to the turn of Jonathan Palmer, he was looked up to as a man of wealth, position, and influence in the community of Accra.</p>

 <p><span class="personal-name">Jonathan Palmer</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had contented himself with money making, but his son and heir, the goodly Tom Palmer, had combined book-learning with his other accomplishments, and gone to the extent of taking the L.Th. degree at the College in <span class="term-freetown"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown" target="_blank">Freetown</a></span>
, though he never had the intention of entering the Church. He was fond of controversy, and as the L.Th. course combined a certain amount of historical information, he had followed it so as to be able to hold his own against all comers, as he pugilistically put it. For a calling he had chosen agriculture, and was an expert in the secrets of soils, manures, and seasons. Not that he practised agriculture, as men practise medicine for example. Oh, dear no! He was a <span class="term-dilettante"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilettante" target="_blank">dilettante</a></span>
 and no more. It was enough for him to be able to say with truth, I am a scientific agriculturist, and I can give you a point or two. Besides, in a community like Accra, where every respectable citizen has a calling, it would not have done to appear a loafer. </p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Tom Palmer </span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>was an ambitious youth. His aim in life was to be the leader of society in the community where it had pleased Providence to place his father and his father‚Äôs father before him. His was the family fortune by right after the pater was gone. He would be the leader of the black aristocracy. What was there to prevent it ? And, so, he set to work with a will. The cut of his coat was always up to date, and, on the Sabbath, he studiously appeared in church in a silk hat and patent leather boots, and never forgot his button-hole and gloves of approved style, though he was never guilty of the solecism of wearing the latter by reason of the tropical temperature. For the same reason also he generally wore his coat sleeves a little turned up, so as to show plenty of linen, and the tips of his trousers followed suit, so that you could count the white buttons on his boots. Other youths of his generation looked on admiringly‚Äîlooked on, and pined, and strove to be like him in appearance, and many succeeded, though they had not Tom Palmer‚Äôs culture, for which his early associations were responsible or his money.</p>

<p>Freetown is an advanced African community. Notwithstanding the fact that some, not having the fear of God in their hearts, have thought it fit to malign her in print, still the (reader may take it from the (writer) that it is a community that has nothing to be ashamed of. It has produced many a distinguished citizen, remarkable alike for intellectual attainments as for business enterprise and success, so much so, that Her late Majesty had thought it not amiss to bestow the honour of knighthood upon one of her esteemed sons. Besides, the city boasts of a cathedral, a rarity in the West African Dependencies. The singing is one of the finest on the West Coast, and men like Canon Spain, Canon Wilson, and Canon Moore, all black clerics, would do honour to any English See. It was no wonder, therefore, that <span class="personal-name">Tom Palmer </span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>was truly proud of his <i>Alma Mater</i>, the <span class="term-fourah-bay-college"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourah_Bay_College" target="_blank">Fourah Bay College</a></span>
, duly affiliated to <span class="term-durham-university"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_University" target="_blank">Durham University</a></span>
, and of the City of Freetown, the <span class="term-mecca"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca" target="_blank">Mecca</a></span>
of <span class="term-west-africa"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa" target="_blank">West Africa</a></span>
. Truly, if there was one thing more than another for which <span class="personal-name">Tom Palmer </span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>revered the memory of his paternal grandfather, it was the utter unselfishness with which he had transmitted the savings of his father before him to his son Jonathan, and the likelihood of the latter obeying the paternal injunction to transmit, in his turn, the family fortune to the next generation, that is, to him, Tom Palmer. Yet, for all that, he could not quite forgive his great forebear for quitting the thriving community by the banks of the Roquelle at the time he did. </p>

<p>With all the lightness of manner we have seen in the subject of this sketch, yet must it be placed to his credit that he was generally most careful when taking any important step in life; and to all the vexed questions in West African social life, perhaps to none had he given such close study as the marriage one. For, mark you, Tom Palmer‚Äôs aim in life was to be the leader of society, the <i>wankora wonkor</i>, as a Fanti would say, in social life at headquarters. Yet he could not make up his mind somehow to do the thing. He had discussed the matter several times with friends without ever coming to a satisfactory issue, and it was, therefore, with particular relish that in conversation with <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> one day, who was at Accra about this time for the Agricultural Show, he managed to introduce his favourite theme. Nor can we blame him. Every young man contemplating marriage does it. He worries everyone he meets upon the subject upon the slightest encouragement, until finally he makes a fool of himself, or escapes by the skin of his teeth. </p>

<p>With an old world complaint upon her lips, the master philosopher met the complainant with the hint that one thing, after all, was essential. We all know the story, but some have, perhaps, not noted the human side of it. The complainant was plainly jealous of the marked attention the master philosopher paid to the younger sister. Her womanly instinct told her that the latter was fast discovering ‚Äúthe one thing needful.‚Äù Her self love asserted itself in the request, ‚ÄúBid her that she help me.‚Äù A charwoman‚Äôs aid would have been as good. But, truth to tell, she would herself sit at the great man‚Äôs feet, if she only knew how. It may be, thoughts like these were passing through <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs mind, as he slowly repeated more to himself than to his companion, the words of the teacher':‚ÄúBut one thing is needful!‚Äù then somewhat abruptly turning to the young man he said, ‚Äú You are making the same mistake that most of us have made. We seem to think that love only comes when she is wooed in Parisian skirts and Regent Street high heels. Know then, my friend, that spiritual sympathy, like the wind, comes we know not whence. Happy the discerning ones who recognise the Queen of Heaven in what ever guise approaches the waiting soul.‚Äù</p>

<p>The young man was puzzled. He spoke his thoughts aloud. ‚ÄúWthat has all this to do with what I heard you muttering about the one thing needful?‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat to do with it? I should think it has all to do with it,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> gravely. ‚Äú You have read he story----- . The master finds a haven, a restful place, in the home of this particular family. Sympathy springs up between him and her who loved to sit at his feet, drinking in, as a thirsty soul, every word that fell from his lips. Interpret the master‚Äôs sentiment as you may. But there is no need to disguise the fact that Mary had found the secret of life.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut then, all this is beside the question, if you will permit me to say so. The sympathy between Christ and Mary was a thing apart, a spiritual relationship, if I may so put it. How can you talk of it in the same breath with mundane matters‚Äîwith the vulgar thing which men profess and affect,‚Äù said Tom Palmer, warming up to the subject in a way that interested his companion greatly. </p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> eyed the young man for a second or two, and then said with a slight tremor in his voice, ‚ÄúIf Jesus was not truly mundane, he would have no interest for you and me. Besides, if you  knew of the gift of the gods, you would not speak of love in the way you have done. At one time I was of like mind as you are, but riper experience has taught me that there is nothing vulgar in love, and that the feeling, in whatever guise it exhibits itself, will be found, in its last analysis, to be the self-same thing, and remember then, that where love is, there God is. Great love, great soul! As the streams flow into the rivers, and the rivers into the sea, and yet the sea is not full, even so docs universal sympathy, from the cooing of the dove to the fervent heat of a Romeo, find its diapason in the God of Love.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúI must confess,‚Äù said the young man, ‚Äú that this way of looking at the matter is altogether new to me. But am I to understand that you would find excuse for the kind of sympathy that flies off at a tangent here, there, and everywhere ? ‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI will state you a stranger proposition then,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> quietly. ‚ÄúRemember, my young friend, to begin with, that love is a spiritual magnetic force, and as I showed at the beginning of our talk, like the wind it bloweth where it listeth. Remember also that there are affinities and repulsions where one might least expect. Oftentimes one starts from the north pole, another from the south, and the magnetic force draws them on and on until they meet, and, in this sense, are we the children of circumstances. Now, think of it. Here is a man of great magnetic force, evoking sympathy and love wherever he goes. But he is a mere man. The corresponding force which he attracts and calls into play here and there becomes created entities, begging for life and claiming the right to live. Tell me, what is the duty of the giver of this life, under God, or to put it materially, the creator of this force? Must he allow free scope to the play of sympathy, or must be ruthlessly set to work to destroy the hope of <i>light</i> which he bids spring up in a human soul? " </p>

<p>‚ÄúAgain, I do not understand you, unless you would imply nothing material in what you say." </p>

<p>‚ÄúI have said nothing that is difficult to understand," pursued <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚Äú Bear in mind I am speaking of true love. I am not referring to a mere wild senseless passion, the result of egoism, the kind of thing which finds satisfaction in multiplying wives, and, from that point of view, I 'speak of things spiritual rather than material. This, then, I say that no one who has the capacity to evoke sympathy in the human soul has the right ruthlessly to quench the fire once his flame has kindled. I will tell you a story if you care to listen."</p>

 <p>‚ÄúGo on, please,‚Äù said the young man.</p>
 <p>‚ÄúWell, here it is. ‚ÄòOnce upon a time there lived a youth who in the heyday of joyous inexperience, as he chanced by a certain out-of-the-way village, evoked love in the breast of a young damsel much below him in degree, and he wot not the full meaning of what he had done. The years rolled leisurely past, and her lover never returned. In the meanwhile, he had become great, gotten himself honour and riches, and, withal, love besides, as he thought. Now and again in the dim recesses of memory a recollection of the maiden would come back to him; but he would say, that is a thing of the past, let the dead past bury its dead. But, as obeying some irresistible impulse, day by day, the thought gained upon him. What was at first a mere curiosity to know what had become of her, grew in intensity until it ended in a regular quest. Abroad he bade his servants go, if, haply, some news might come of her for whom his soul panted. But no news came. At last he gave up hope, and seemed to take no delight in his goodly surroundings, nay; not even in his wife, nor in his children and his home. One day, outside the city gate, as he returned from a lonely walk, he saw walking towards him the self-same woman whom youthful inexperience turned not back to see. Their eyes met. They had both aged so. They had also suffered. She frankly put forth her hands. His touched hers. ‚ÄúAt last! " she exclaimed, " my woman‚Äôs heart told me sooner or later we should meet again.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd mine has been long lonely without thee,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMoreover, riper knowledge has taught me that in the kingdom of love, nothing is ever lost.‚Äù</p>

 <p>"The story ended, the teller paused for a second, and then added, ‚ÄúMaybe you will now see in a truer light the one thing needful which shall not be taken away from her.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNow putting philosophy aside for the moment, I daresay you have flirted a little in your time,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, good-humouredly, then, with a mischievous twinkle, ‚Äú and you may have a child, a poor nameless one, in some out-of-the-way corner of the world. You needn‚Äôt be shy about it. All of us do do it, though not all of us are men enough to own it. Now, believe me, my friend, any child of Eve, who has deliberately become their mother of your child is worthy of your love, and  to treat her as an outcast is to be unworthy of the ' name of a man. In this wise, we pagans are more Christ-like than so-called Christians. ' He-'- that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again, He stooped down and wrote on the ground,‚Äô ‚Äù he quoted somewhat irrelevantly, then continued: ‚Äú In Africa, she is protected; she is a wife. Call it polygamy, if you like. In so-called Christian countries she is despised, a prostitute, a leper.‚Äù </p>

<p>In the fullness of time, <span class="personal-name">Tom Palmer </span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>got married. None of his wives sought to be a leader of society, and he was well content. He himself did not seem likely, now that he had come to his heritage, that he would fulfil the promise of his early ambition. In due course the little ones came ‚Äîso gladsome their little black faces wherever they appeared, the fulfilment of the radiant love which gave them birth. And as the years rolled by, it was sure that his girls were growing up to be useful members of the community, for <span class="personal-name">Tom Palmer </span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>had made up his mind that he would have no Parisian skirts or Regent Street high-heeled nonsense, as he bluntly put it, nor would he ever condescend to explain himself. </p>

                            <p>Tandor-Kuma lay sick with <span class="term-malaria"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria" target="_blank">malaria</a></span>
. The fast boat that should have borne him to the bosom of his family had come and gone. In his dreams he had been talking wildly, and asking when the boat would be in. </p>

<p>It was not without reason that his uppermost thoughts seemed to hover about the movements of the steamers. There was in this house where he lay stricken, as a nurse, the mother of his first child‚Äîthe kind of child the world sneers at and elects to ignore, who, nevertheless thrives and prospers to the amazement of those who talk glibly of the inscrutable ways of Providence. </p>

<p>He had hoped that in the few days he had to spend upon the business which brought him down, he would be so occupied and pressed with engagements, that he could very well manage to evade meeting more than in a casual way the mother of his child. And now a fortnight must elapse before he would be well enough to travel, and during that time what was to happen? </p>

<p>It is an unpleasant truth that in the first flush of the shame of the mother of his child, instead of bearing up bravely and sharing the shame with her, like the coward man that he was, he had gone so far as to protest that he was not the father of the child, and had allowed her alone to pass through the valley of humiliation; but the God whom she had wronged, according to the theologians, had not suffered her to be entirely crushed. Meanwhile, Tandor-Kuma had succeeded in life, mounted up steadily in his calling, been happily married, and was a most respectable member of society. To do him justice, he was absolutely true to his wife, whom he loved, and never meant to be otherwise. In fact the contrast between his early escapades and his present constancy and devotion to his family was the common talk of those who had known him in early life. </p>

<p>And here was he, after all these years, confronted with the same forbidden fruit of his early days. He was young and full of fire in those days, it is true. He had fallen then. Was it likely he could resist now that he began to feel the same old witchery taking possession of his heart, and making a fool of him, if not in deed, in very intention? ‚Äúo, God! " he cried, ardently and sincerely, ‚Äúsave me from this.‚Äù But even while he cried, another voice within him said, ‚ÄúWhat docs it matter? Is it your fault that you are stranded here ? ‚Äù</p>

 <p>In the domestic arrangements of a West African home there is hardly any system; and so it happens that the master or mistress orders about the nearest hand available. This was a kind of hospital home. What was more natural than that Ekuba should gradually work her way to the bedside of him whom her heart adored ? When the fever had abated a bit, now and again she would steal in with some daintily prepared refreshment which she would coax the patient to partake of. She would often stay to say a word and to smooth his pillows. On such occasions Tandor-Kuma would seem ill at ease, and appear as if struggling with some inward emotion.</p>

 <p>Careful nursing had brought Tandor-Kuma back to health; but, as it sometimes happens in West Africa, the boat that was to take the convalescent home had not turned up according to the time-table, and time was hanging most painfully on his hands; and every day the Titan of sheer sympathy was tightening its grasp stronger and stronger‚Äù round his heart, leaving his senses reeling. </p>

<p>One evening <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> came to clear away the supper and found Tandor-Kuma sitting at a corner of the room reading, the others having gone to a Fanti concert. She boldly drew a chair, and eat down near him. </p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat a jolly thing your steamer delaying like this. Supposing she did not come for another week or so, I wonder whatever will happen? " Tandor-Kuma raised up a finger deprecatingly.</p>

 <p>"I know,‚Äù continued <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, not heeding the warning one little bit, ‚Äúthat you are dying to get back to the bosom of your dear family‚Äîthat is what they call it, isn‚Äôt it? But what must be, must be.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat do you mean, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, you talk rather strangely to-night.‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúI simply mean this, that I have missed you badly all these years, and now that the spirits of my fathers have thrown you in my way once more, surely you will not begrudge me a little of your society. I took a job here with your kinsman, the doctor, feeling sure you would one day turn up.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk like that, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. You know I must be careful. I am a married man, and I must think of my wife and children.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúIf it comes to that,‚Äù she said, " I am your first wife, and the second is an interloper.‚Äù So saying, she burst out into a wild laugh. The situation was becoming perilous and yet comical, and Tandor-Kuma could not restrain a laugh too. Here he was with the woman, who first raised sympathy in him, confronting him with a naivete that was. quite unusual. Should he repulse her?. He quickly decided that the wisest course was to humour her and talk the matter out in a half- bantering, half-serious way with her. </p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know," said <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, taking advantage of a momentary pause on the part of Tandor-Kuma, " the last time you were here, and you had to go away so suddenly, when I came and found you were gone, I was so sorry," looking at Tandor- Kuma defiantly. </p>

<p>‚ÄúWere you? I am not surprised. You see we all make mistakes in life, and we are expected to pull ourselves together and go straight after. If not, often the last stage is worse than the first. You don‚Äôt wish to see me down, do you? " </p>

<p>‚ÄúIt depends upon what you mean by seeing you down. Kobina had to come, and nothing could prevent it; and I have waited all these years," repeating the last words with a slow emphasis and a weariness of tone which struck Tandor-Kuma. awkwardly.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúIf you talk like that, I shall never come to this place again, when I go away this time.‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter; I shall wait; and it may be some sudden business or family matter will bring you down." Tandor-Kuma revolved in his mind how to meet this flank move. Meanwhile she continued: ‚ÄòYou know I go to chapel? Last night the minister told us in his address that, once upon a time, there was a king who was in the habit of killing his subjects for no good reason. One day he sent for a parson. The good man feared and wondered whatever was going to happen. lie made excuses, but eventually had to go. While going he broke his leg. It took some days to set him right, and he was well enough to continue his journey. When he arrived at the king‚Äôs palace, he was dead, and so the parson was saved.‚Äù She stopped short, eyeing the man she loved feverishly. </p>

<p>‚ÄúWell?‚Äù interrogated Tandor-Kuma. </p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, simply this that what must be must be, and what must not be must not be‚Äîthat is the rule of the gods‚Äô'‚Äîpointing her little chin up triumphantly. ‚ÄúAnd after all,‚Äù she went on. "was it such a grave error? You know the murderer was not saved, but the thief was.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúBut what if the thief went on stealing,‚Äù retorted Tandor-Kuma. ‚ÄúIt is like going against the light.‚Äù ‚ÄúLight, then darkness,‚Äù <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> put in with a far away look in her eyes.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúYes, but when the light comes, then darkness goes away,‚Äù suggested Tandor-Kuma.</p>

<p> It was all very fine, this toying with fine phrases and sentiments when passion answered to passion in the breasts of two human beings. <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> lapsed into silence, and it was evident that both man and woman were struggling with the same inward emotion. </p>

<p> ‚ÄúBut tell me,‚Äù Tandor-Kuma incautiously broke out, ‚Äúwhat made you run away from me the last time I was here before I got married.‚Äù </p>
<p>‚ÄúHow simple you men are? I ran away from you? It was not so. I simply went to avoid compromising you in any way.‚Äù </p>

<p>Tandor-Kuma would have liked a little time to reflect. But suddenly <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> swept away the supper things, and, in a moment, she was gone.</p>

<p>The next morning, a gentle tap was heard at the door of Tandor-Kuma, and a voice from within said, ‚Äúcome in.‚Äù <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> boldly entered, and placing down some clean linen, flung herself at Tandor-Kuma‚Äôs feet, who was already dressed and reclining in a low chair by the open window. Tandor-Kuma got up and faced her. </p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat is this you have done,‚Äù he said under his breath, -perceiving the awkwardness of the situation. For answer <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> got up and deliberately locked the door upon the outside world. Then facing the man, she said, ‚ÄúTandor- Kuma, these many years my heart has hungered for your sympathy, and now that the gods have brought you back to me, surely, you will not deny me one kind word. Just say you care for me a little. That is all I want.‚Äù</p>

<p> Tandor-Kuma made a move as if he would unbolt the door. In that instant <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> held him spell-bound with a look so pitiful, so imploring, so passionate that he quailed before her gaze. He The next moment he Erring love had con- hesitated, then wavered, completely broke down, quered, that was all.</p>
