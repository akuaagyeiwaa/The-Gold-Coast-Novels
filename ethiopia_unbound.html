                <h2>Joseph Ephraim Casely-Hayford</h2>
                <div class="author-info">

                    <p>Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, also known by his native name Ekra Agyiman, was born on September 28, 1866, and died in 1930. His father, Reverend Joseph de Graft Hayford‚Äîoriginally named Kwamina Affua‚Äîhad his name changed by Christian missionaries, reflecting the colonial imposition on indigenous identities (Ofosu-Appiah x). Casely Hayford began his formal education at Wesleyan High School in Cape Coast and later proceeded to Fourah Bay College in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He returned to teach at his alma mater and was subsequently appointed principal of the Wesleyan High School in Accra.</P>

                    <p>Casely Hayford‚Äôs intellectual pursuits extended beyond the classroom into journalism and the legal profession. He collaborated with Prince Brew of Dunkwa at the Western Echo press and, in 1893, joined the Gold Coast Chronicle as a sub-editor. He later served as the editor of the Gold Coast Echo. During this period, he also worked as a law clerk for Mr. Eiolart, a European lawyer based in Cape Coast.</p>

                    <p>In 1893, Casely Hayford traveled to England to study law at the Inner Temple. While in England, he also matriculated as a non-collegiate student at the University of Cambridge for a year. He was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1896 and subsequently returned to the Gold Coast, where he practiced law in Cape Coast, Axim, Sekondi, and Accra.</p>

                    <p>His personal life was marked by both tragedy and resilience. His first marriage to Beatrice Madeline Pinnock produced one child, but she died in childbirth during the delivery of their second. He later married Gladys Smith of Freetown. Two of his children‚ÄîArchie Casely Hayford and Adelaide Casely-Hayford‚Äîsurvived him.</p>

                    <p>Casely Hayford's contributions to political thought and African nationalism have earned him considerable scholarly acclaim. Ugonna (1969) describes him as ‚Äúperhaps the greatest nationalist leader in West Africa of his time‚Äù (vii). His biographer, Magnus J. Sampson (1969), observes that Casely Hayford ‚Äúpursued an unremitting career of political and literary labour,‚Äù asserting that his published works earned him ‚Äúa foremost place among the men of letters of his day‚Äù (162). Sampson further emphasizes his stature by arguing:</p>

                            <p>‚ÄúStudents of British West African history will [...] concede that no remarkable career is recorded in the whole British West African politics other than that of Mr. Casely Hayford, who towered above every politician and statesman in British West Africa after [Edward] Blyden and [John Mensah] Sarbah‚Äù (160‚Äì61).</p>

                    <p>Casely Hayford was a polymath‚Äîeducationist, journalist, lawyer, politician, statesman, and patriot‚Äîwhose influence spanned multiple domains (Osei-Nyame 143). His legacy is especially significant for his literary contribution to Pan-Africanism. Unlike his contemporaries such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Edward Blyden, and Marcus Garvey, Casely Hayford was unique in having ‚Äúfictionalised the idea‚Äù of Pan-Africanism in his novel Ethiopia Unbound (Ugonna 1977, 159). In addition to this seminal work, he authored Gold Coast Native Institutions (1903), Gold Coast Land Tenure and the Forest Bill (1911), and Truth About West African Land Question (1913).</p>

                            <p>At the dawn of the twentieth century, men of light, and leading-both in <span class="term-europe"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank">Europe</a></span>
 and in <span class="place-name-america"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America" target="_blank">America</a></span>
 had not yet made up their minds as to what place to assign to the spiritual aspirations of the black man; and the Nations were casting about for an answer to the wail which went up from the heart the oppressed‚Äô race for opportunity. And yet it was at best but an impotent cry. For there has never lived a people worth writing about who have not shaped out a destiny for themselves, or carved out their own opportunity.

 </p>

</P>Before this time, however, it had been discovered that the black man was not necessarily the missing link between man and ape. It had even been granted that for intellectual endowments he had nothing to be ashamed of in an open competition with the <span class="personal-name-aryan"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan" target="_blank">Aryan</a></span> or any other type. Here was a being anatomically perfect. adaptive and adaptable to any and every sphere of the struggle for life. Sociologically, he had succeeded in recording upon the pages of contemporary history a conception of family life unknown to Western ideas. Moreover, he was the scion of a spiritual sphere peculiar unto himself; for when Western Nations would have exhausted their energy in the vain struggle for the things which satisfy not, it was felt that it would be to these people to whom the world would turn for inspiration, seeing that in them only would be found those elements which make for pure altruism, the leaven of all human experience.</p>

<p>Again, the art of the caricaturist had by now, been played out. It was no longer possible, as ' far as this race was concerned, to depict the if Sultan of <span class="place-name-zanzibar"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar" target="_blank">Zanzibar</a></span>, for example, other than as an Ethiopian gentleman, ‚Äúclothed and in his right mind.‚Äù </p>

<p>And there were sons of God among them, men whom the Gods visited as of yore; for even now three continents were ringing with the names:	of men like Du Lois, Looker T. Washington Blyden, Dunbar, Coleridge Taylor, and others‚Äî men who had distinguished themselves in the fields of activity and intellectuality‚Äîand it was by no means an uncommon thing to meet in the  	 universities of <span class="place-name-europe"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank">Europe</a></span> and <span class="place-name-america"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America" target="_blank">America</a></span>
 the sons of <span class="place-name-ethiopia"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia" target="_blank">Ethiopia</a></span>
 in quest of the golden tree of knowledge. Here, in <span class="place-name-london"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" target="_blank">London</a></span>
, about the time of write, were to be seen two young men, walking arm in arm up <span class="place-name-tottenham-court-road"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Court_Road" target="_blank">Tottenham Court Road</a></span>
, and, ever and anon, stopping to examine old dirty books in some second-class bookstall, or some quaint relics in a curiosity shop. </p>

<p>Presently, the twain stopped at a particularly ancient looking bookshop oil a by-street leading to Upper <span class="place-name-bedford"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford" target="_blank">Bedford</a></span>
 Place. The darker man of the two picked up from the stall outside, a well- thumbed copy of <span class="personal-name-marcus-aurelius"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius" target="_blank">Marcus Aurelius</a></span>
, and began carelessly to turn over the leaves. Suddenly he stopped, and his face grew pensive. Turning to his friend, he said, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it funny,<span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, the remarkable similarity of thought and almost of expression there is between all the great teachers of the past? Listen to what, for instance, -'<span class="personal-name">Marcus Aurelius</span> <script src="scripts.js">says here,‚Äù reading aloud a paragraph from the Meditations, which ran thus: ‚ÄòPray not to save ‚Äúthy child, but that thou f mayest not fear to lose him.‚Äô Now, you, a Divinity student,, what do you make of that? ‚Äù And without waiting for an answer, he added, ‚ÄúDoes it not read very much like the teaching of the holy <span class="personal-name-nazarene"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazarene" target="_blank">Nazarene</a></span>
‚Äî‚Äò He that findeth his life, shall lose it,‚Äô or words to that effect? Now, what I wish to know is what had <span class="personal-name-jesus-christ"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank">Jesus Christ</a></span>
 in common with Marcus Aurelius?‚Äù </p>

<p>"Candidly, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>
,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚ÄúI have never given the matter a thought; but since you put the question, and viewing it from a merely debatable standpoint, I am inclined to say that the first question to consider is whether <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was man or God.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> raised his eyes in astonishment. ‚ÄúYou do surprise me, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; how can you, of all others, have any doubt upon the matter? I thought you were going up for Orders.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> appeared confused, but soon regaining composure, he said to his companion, " Let us move on.‚Äù</p>

<p>As they sauntered along, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> began: ‚ÄúYou know, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I can talk better walking, and I will now answer the question you put to me a while ago. At one time I thought of taking Orders, and even now I may do so. But a little evil thing in the shape of an unanswerable doubt haunts me by day and night and it is even the self-same question I put to you at the book shop.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I hardly know what to say, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. In these matters, I, of course, regard myself as an outsider. You see we pagans come all the way here to sit at the feet of <span class="personal-name-gamaliel"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamaliel" target="_blank">Gamaliel</a></span>
,‚Äù he said with a little mischievous Laugh, and it is uncommonly hard upon us for you to entertain doubts upon the broad questions upon which we seek comparison and light. But I can conceive of no such difficulty as you experience in our system; <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> man or God? " he repeated slowly and musingly unto himself‚Äîthen turning somewhat suddenly to his friend, he said, " You know, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, since I learnt your language, not as a vehicle of thought, but as a means of‚Äîmore intimately studying your philosophy, I have been trying to get at the root idea of the word ‚Äò God '; and so far as my researches have-gone, it is an <span class="place-name-anglo-saxon"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon" target="_blank">Anglo-Saxon</a></span>
 word, the <span class="place-name-teutonic"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutonic" target="_blank">Teutonic</a></span>
 form being <span class="place-name-gutha"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutha" target="_blank">Gutha</a></span>
, which is said to be quite distinct from ‚Äò good.‚Äô Whence then, one may ask, come your ideas, as associated with the fountain of all good, of omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence? Of course they are borrowed from <span class="place-name-romans"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romans" target="_blank">The Romans</a></span>
, who were <span class="place-name-pagans"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism" target="_blank">Pagans</a></span>
 like ourselves, and who, indeed, had much to learn from the <span class="place-name-ethiopians"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopians" target="_blank">Ethiopians</a></span>
 through <span class="place-name-greeks"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks" target="_blank">The Greeks</a></span>
.‚Äù</p>

 <p>A turn or two took the young men to <span class="place-name-russell-square"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Square" target="_blank">Russell Square</a></span>
, and soon they found themselves at Bedford Place. The darker man of the two produced a latch-key, and invited his companion to come in. There was nothing remarkable about the rooms except that they were furnished in the Oriental style. Here and there, at convenient corners, were divans with rich cushions, embroidered in silk, and carpets of leopard skins into which the feet sank as one walked. On the walls were trophies, consisting principally of African weapons. There were to be seen a collection of musical instruments of all descriptions, some so simple as to make one ' wonder how any symphony could be got out of them. A well-filled shelf, with a plain oak desk, littered with written matter, with some flowers here and there, about completed the outward circumstance of the room into which our visitor was ushered. Pushing well forward the only easy chair in the room, and placing his friend in it with a smile of welcome, he threw himself upon a low seat beside him, touched a bell on a side table, and ordered some refreshment.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt mind my old-world ways,‚Äù remarked <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúYou know, though I have lived in this country fairly long, off and on, I like to sniff a bit of the African air somehow where‚Äôer I go.‚Äù </p>

<p> ‚ÄúThat is perfectly natural, at least with a well-balanced mind,‚Äù correcting himself, said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; ‚Äúbut what I can‚Äôt understand is that you don‚Äôt seem a bit Eastern in your methods of work. To judge from that pile yonder,‚Äù eyeing the notes mischievously, ‚Äúone wouldn‚Äôt think you were over here for a holiday.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, that is only a bit of derivative work.</p>

<p>You have no idea how interesting it is. Would you like to see what -I am-doing ? ‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúHow good of you! I should be delighted.‚Äù ‚ÄúI shall soon be finishing now,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> excitedly. ‚ÄúYou see I am at the letter ‚Äò Y.‚Äô And that reminds me: you remember a while ago my taking you to task over the feebleness of the idear-of ‚Äò God‚Äô in ‚Äúthe Anglo-Saxon language. -I have just got the corresponding word here in Fanti. It is a big word, so big that you can hardly manage it :‚Äî </p>

<p>Nyiakropon.</p>

<p>Does it convey any meaning to you? How can it ? And yet, I can assure you, my friend, it is no mere barbarous jargon. It is the combination of distinct root ideas in one word. It relates back to the beginning of all things visible and links the intelligent part of man with the great Intelligence of the universe. Breaking up the word into its component parts, as I have done, we have:‚Äî </p>

<p>Nyia nu/ku ara oye, pon. That is, </p>
He who alone is great?'
 <p>‚ÄúHow very suggestive. Who should have thought it?‚Äù observed <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, enthusiastically. " Well, let us take the next word, then,</p>

 <p>Nyami, </p>

<p>which is still more suggestive, and analyse it. Broken up, it stands in bold relief thus :‚Äî </p>

<p>Nyia oye emi. That is, </p>

<p>He who is lam. </p>
<p>Now compare the <span class="place-name-hebrew"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew" target="_blank">Hebrew</a></span>
 lam hath sent me, and you have it. Nor is this a fanciful play upon roots, for our people sing unto this day:</p>
<p>‚ÄòWana si onyi Nyami se?</p>
<p>Dasayi wo ho inde, okina na onyi, </p>
<p>Nyami firi tsitsi kaisi odumankuma.‚Äô</p>
<p>meaning: </p>
<p>‚ÄòWho says he is equal with God?</p>
 			<p>Man is to-day, to-morrow he is not,</p>
 			<p>lam is from eternity to eternity.‚Äô </p>
<p>‚ÄúYou can now understand,‚Äù continued <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> in a low, sad tone, " why your difficulty surprised me. But now that I come to think of it, it may be due to the limitations of your language.' 	 " After what you have just shown me, I must confess there is a deal in what you say; and somehow you Orientals manage to keep your hold on the eternal verities, where we flounder and are lost.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúPardon me, my good friend, not quite that. As yet you are only drifting, drifting, drifting away from the ancient moorings that you Westerners built in sand. <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> came from the East. In <span class="place-name-bethlehem"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem" target="_blank">Bethlehem</a></span>
  he was born, and in <span class="place-name-egypt"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" target="_blank">Egypt</a></span>
 was he nurtured; and, yet, you seek to teach Him us. We have caught His Spirit and live; you follow the letter and are tossed hither and thither by every wind. Forgive me when I say that the future of ‚Äû the world is with the East. The nation that can, Ji in the next century, show the greatest output of spiritual strength, that is the nation that shall lead the world, and as <span class="personal-name-buddha"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha" target="_blank">Buddha</a></span>
 from <span class="place-name-africa"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" target="_blank">Africa</a></span>
 taught <span class="place-name-asia"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" target="_blank">Asia</a></span>
, so may Africa again lead the way.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI am not prepared to dispute the matter with you, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and there seems to be a good deal of truth in-what you say; but how about the doubt deep down in my own heart? That is a personal affair you know. In a word, what think you of the Christ ? ‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúWhat a clever dialectician you are, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, l to be sure? If_I_did not know you so well,  I would hardly think you were serious. You throw back to me the question I put to you a while ago, and you lay upon me the burden of solving my own riddle.‚Äù </p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs voice was low and sad with a suspicion of emotion in his whole manner, as he said: ‚ÄúForgive me, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> if I have seemed flippant; I was never more serious in my life. I have arrived at a crisis in my career which may mean disaster at any moment; and, what is more, until this day I have never had the courage to' speak it out to any of my friends for fear they would mock at my doubts.‚Äù</p>

 <p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> turned upon his friend a look full of penetration and sympathy; and, for the moment, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> felt uneasy under the searching glance of the Eastern student. It seemed to him as if in that instant <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had probed his inner nature and found it shallow. </p>

<p>According to our ideas, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, one broad (divinity runs through humanity, and whether we are gods, or we are men, depends upon how far we (nave given way to the divine influence operating upon our humanity; and, comparing one system with another, I must confess there was in the man Christ Jesus a greater share of divinity than in any teacher before or after Him, and that was in my mind when I was wondering what <span class="personal-name">Marcus Aurelius</span> <script src="scripts.js"> had in common with <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>.‚Äù </p>

<p> ‚ÄúBut tell me, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, supposing <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had been born of an Ethiopian woman instead of Mary of the line of David, do you think it would have made any difference in the way he influenced mankind? ‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat a strange question,‚Äù returned <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; ‚Äúour Lord born of an Ethiopian woman?‚Äùforgetting his doubts for the moment‚Äî‚Äú Whatever put such an idea into your head? I am sure you are the first man who has given expression to such a thought.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, it is strange ‚Äù‚Äîand there was "a vibration of the intensest pathos in <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs voice  ‚Äî‚Äú that an African should venture to think that the Holy One of God might have been born of his I race. I can easily interpret your thoughts; but, I tell me, what is there extraordinary in the idea? " I " Oh, I don‚Äôt know. Habits of thought, convention, and all 'that sort of thing, I suppose. And yet I am hardly qualified to speak upon these things,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, softening.</p>

<p> He rose to go. He was due farther west to see his people. Before leaving, he laid a hand on <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs shoulder, and looking gravely into his face, he said: ‚ÄúIt is a pity, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I did not meet you a little earlier in my career. But even now, it may not be too late. Good-bye! Mind you meet me at <span class="place-name-liverpool-street-station"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Street_station" target="_blank">Liverpool Street Station</a></span>
 before the hour for the night train up. Goodbye!‚Äù</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="accordion-item">
                        <button class="accordion-header">Chapter 2: Sowing the Wind</button>
                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p> SILENCE prevailed in the room, except for the stitch, stitch, stitch, of a woman past the early bloom of womanhood who, at first stitching merely to pass away the time, now thrust, the needle j' viciously into the embroidery, as if bent upon ' drawing some secret from the heart of the silken cords of life.</p>

<p>Presently she began to cry‚Äîhot burning tears  which flowed from the passion of a heart which nought for rest and found none. </p>

<p>The curtains were down, and, save a glowing lire which a young student kept poking for no reason at all, the atmosphere of the room, as far ns these two souls were concerned, was in strange keeping with the fog outside. They were man and wife, these two, at least before God. Of his own free will he had made love to her in far away Africa, and she had responded. But that was years ago. She, then, a buxom, lively lass, he an intelligent youth of the National University. She, now in <span class="place-name-england"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" target="_blank">England</a></span>
, only a nurse-maid; he a successful student, equipped and ready to carry all the world before him. Yes, they were man and wife, these two; yet were they both ill at ease, and the young man would have willingly trusted himself to the tender mercies of‚Äîthe London fog. Yet he could not go. It was the law of compensation. He was fairly caught in his own meshes, and fate called upon him to face the music.</p>

<p>To do Tandor-Kuma justice, for that was the youth‚Äôs name, he had always intended to remain steadfast in his promise to <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. But now the circumstances were changed, and he was doing his best to grapple with a most difficult situation. How could he, a professional man, used to all the luxuries of English life and habit, take back with him to start a career in Africa a nurse-maid ? And what would he do, if asked to Government house? Thoughts such as these passed through his mind and-made him obdurate to the pleading of the woman a his feet.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúIf you cry again, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I shall leave you.  You know it is-too bad when I am doing all my best to amuse you in this horribly depressing weather.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, you needn‚Äôt trouble about that, Tandor- Kuma. I know you will leave me in any event. You don‚Äôt think I have lived all these years without knowing what you men are. You press weak women into your service, and when you have won their sympathy, for a dream you toss them away like this,‚Äù viciously kicking at the rug before the fire.
‚ÄúNow, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, try and be reasonable. You mustn‚Äôt think I am going to desert you. Bad as we men are, we have our ideals, and we never rest until we realise them.‚Äù
 ‚Äú Good! That beats all the cant I have ever heard! What is the next, pray? And women have no ideals, of course! Uncultured women do not feel, do not think! They are just like clay in the hands of you men to mould‚Äîto make or mar.‚Äù</p>

 <p>" Now you are getting angry. Let us discuss this matter dispassionately.‚Äù</p>

<p> Instead of that, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> burst into a paroxysm of grief which Tandor-Kuma found it hard to control. By degrees, she grew calmer, and, sticking a pin or two in her head-gear, she snatched up her wraps and stood ready to depart. " </p>

<p>Tandor-Kuma,‚Äù she said, " you have your ideals, and I have mine. Let us part like friends.  I shall not give you the opportunity of dismissing me like a cur. Good-bye, of the present! It may be we shall meet again.‚Äù And before the young student could frame a suitable answer, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was gone. </p>
