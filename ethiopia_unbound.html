                <h2>Joseph Ephraim Casely-Hayford</h2>
                <div class="author-info">

                    <p>Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, also known by his native name Ekra Agyiman, was born on September 28, 1866, and died in 1930. His father, Reverend Joseph de Graft Hayford‚Äîoriginally named Kwamina Affua‚Äîhad his name changed by Christian missionaries, reflecting the colonial imposition on indigenous identities (Ofosu-Appiah x). Casely Hayford began his formal education at Wesleyan High School in Cape Coast and later proceeded to Fourah Bay College in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He returned to teach at his alma mater and was subsequently appointed principal of the Wesleyan High School in Accra.</P>

                    <p>Casely Hayford‚Äôs intellectual pursuits extended beyond the classroom into journalism and the legal profession. He collaborated with Prince Brew of Dunkwa at the Western Echo press and, in 1893, joined the Gold Coast Chronicle as a sub-editor. He later served as the editor of the Gold Coast Echo. During this period, he also worked as a law clerk for Mr. Eiolart, a European lawyer based in Cape Coast.</p>

                    <p>In 1893, Casely Hayford traveled to England to study law at the Inner Temple. While in England, he also matriculated as a non-collegiate student at the University of Cambridge for a year. He was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1896 and subsequently returned to the Gold Coast, where he practiced law in Cape Coast, Axim, Sekondi, and Accra.</p>

                    <p>His personal life was marked by both tragedy and resilience. His first marriage to Beatrice Madeline Pinnock produced one child, but she died in childbirth during the delivery of their second. He later married Gladys Smith of Freetown. Two of his children‚ÄîArchie Casely Hayford and Adelaide Casely-Hayford‚Äîsurvived him.</p>

                    <p>Casely Hayford's contributions to political thought and African nationalism have earned him considerable scholarly acclaim. Ugonna (1969) describes him as ‚Äúperhaps the greatest nationalist leader in West Africa of his time‚Äù (vii). His biographer, Magnus J. Sampson (1969), observes that Casely Hayford ‚Äúpursued an unremitting career of political and literary labour,‚Äù asserting that his published works earned him ‚Äúa foremost place among the men of letters of his day‚Äù (162). Sampson further emphasizes his stature by arguing:</p>

                            <p>‚ÄúStudents of British West African history will [...] concede that no remarkable career is recorded in the whole British West African politics other than that of Mr. Casely Hayford, who towered above every politician and statesman in British West Africa after [Edward] Blyden and [John Mensah] Sarbah‚Äù (160‚Äì61).</p>

                    <p>Casely Hayford was a polymath‚Äîeducationist, journalist, lawyer, politician, statesman, and patriot‚Äîwhose influence spanned multiple domains (Osei-Nyame 143). His legacy is especially significant for his literary contribution to Pan-Africanism. Unlike his contemporaries such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Edward Blyden, and Marcus Garvey, Casely Hayford was unique in having ‚Äúfictionalised the idea‚Äù of Pan-Africanism in his novel Ethiopia Unbound (Ugonna 1977, 159). In addition to this seminal work, he authored Gold Coast Native Institutions (1903), Gold Coast Land Tenure and the Forest Bill (1911), and Truth About West African Land Question (1913).</p>

                    his credentials to the Secretary for Education of the Omanhin, who, having a list of districts ready for a
                    teacher, would at once introduce the new-comer.

                    upon his own energy and the interest he brought into his work, and, what was more, his rise to the maximum
                    stipend would be the result of the maximum success expected. As if a rule, the teachers were men who had
                    their heart in their work, and the filling of the schools was a matter of two or three months.

</P>Before this time, however, it had been discovered that the black man was not necessarily the missing link between man and ape. It had even been granted that for intellectual endowments he had nothing to be ashamed of in an open competition with the <span class="personal-name-aryan"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan" target="_blank">Aryan</a></span> or any other type. Here was a being anatomically perfect. adaptive and adaptable to any and every sphere of the struggle for life. Sociologically, he had succeeded in recording upon the pages of contemporary history a conception of family life unknown to Western ideas. Moreover, he was the scion of a spiritual sphere peculiar unto himself; for when Western Nations would have exhausted their energy in the vain struggle for the things which satisfy not, it was felt that it would be to these people to whom the world would turn for inspiration, seeing that in them only would be found those elements which make for pure altruism, the leaven of all human experience.</p>

<p>Again, the art of the caricaturist had by now, been played out. It was no longer possible, as ' far as this race was concerned, to depict the if Sultan of <span class="place-name-zanzibar"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar" target="_blank">Zanzibar</a></span>, for example, other than as an Ethiopian gentleman, ‚Äúclothed and in his right mind.‚Äù </p>

<p>And there were sons of God among them, men whom the Gods visited as of yore; for even now three continents were ringing with the names:	of men like Du Lois, Looker T. Washington Blyden, Dunbar, Coleridge Taylor, and others‚Äî men who had distinguished themselves in the fields of activity and intellectuality‚Äîand it was by no means an uncommon thing to meet in the  	 universities of <span class="place-name-europe"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank">Europe</a></span> and <span class="place-name-america"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America" target="_blank">America</a></span>
 the sons of <span class="place-name-ethiopia"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia" target="_blank">Ethiopia</a></span>
 in quest of the golden tree of knowledge. Here, in <span class="place-name-london"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" target="_blank">London</a></span>
, about the time of write, were to be seen two young men, walking arm in arm up <span class="place-name-tottenham-court-road"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Court_Road" target="_blank">Tottenham Court Road</a></span>
, and, ever and anon, stopping to examine old dirty books in some second-class bookstall, or some quaint relics in a curiosity shop. </p>

<p>Presently, the twain stopped at a particularly ancient looking bookshop oil a by-street leading to Upper <span class="place-name-bedford"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford" target="_blank">Bedford</a></span>
 Place. The darker man of the two picked up from the stall outside, a well- thumbed copy of <span class="personal-name-marcus-aurelius"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius" target="_blank">Marcus Aurelius</a></span>
, and began carelessly to turn over the leaves. Suddenly he stopped, and his face grew pensive. Turning to his friend, he said, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it funny,<span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, the remarkable similarity of thought and almost of expression there is between all the great teachers of the past? Listen to what, for instance, -'<span class="personal-name">Marcus Aurelius</span> <script src="scripts.js">says here,‚Äù reading aloud a paragraph from the Meditations, which ran thus: ‚ÄòPray not to save ‚Äúthy child, but that thou f mayest not fear to lose him.‚Äô Now, you, a Divinity student,, what do you make of that? ‚Äù And without waiting for an answer, he added, ‚ÄúDoes it not read very much like the teaching of the holy <span class="personal-name-nazarene"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazarene" target="_blank">Nazarene</a></span>
‚Äî‚Äò He that findeth his life, shall lose it,‚Äô or words to that effect? Now, what I wish to know is what had <span class="personal-name-jesus-christ"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank">Jesus Christ</a></span>
 in common with Marcus Aurelius?‚Äù </p>

<p>"Candidly, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>
,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚ÄúI have never given the matter a thought; but since you put the question, and viewing it from a merely debatable standpoint, I am inclined to say that the first question to consider is whether <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was man or God.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> raised his eyes in astonishment. ‚ÄúYou do surprise me, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; how can you, of all others, have any doubt upon the matter? I thought you were going up for Orders.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> appeared confused, but soon regaining composure, he said to his companion, " Let us move on.‚Äù</p>

<p>As they sauntered along, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> began: ‚ÄúYou know, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I can talk better walking, and I will now answer the question you put to me a while ago. At one time I thought of taking Orders, and even now I may do so. But a little evil thing in the shape of an unanswerable doubt haunts me by day and night and it is even the self-same question I put to you at the book shop.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I hardly know what to say, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. In these matters, I, of course, regard myself as an outsider. You see we pagans come all the way here to sit at the feet of <span class="personal-name-gamaliel"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamaliel" target="_blank">Gamaliel</a></span>
,‚Äù he said with a little mischievous Laugh, and it is uncommonly hard upon us for you to entertain doubts upon the broad questions upon which we seek comparison and light. But I can conceive of no such difficulty as you experience in our system; <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> man or God? " he repeated slowly and musingly unto himself‚Äîthen turning somewhat suddenly to his friend, he said, " You know, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, since I learnt your language, not as a vehicle of thought, but as a means of‚Äîmore intimately studying your philosophy, I have been trying to get at the root idea of the word ‚Äò God '; and so far as my researches have-gone, it is an <span class="place-name-anglo-saxon"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon" target="_blank">Anglo-Saxon</a></span>
 word, the <span class="place-name-teutonic"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutonic" target="_blank">Teutonic</a></span>
 form being <span class="place-name-gutha"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutha" target="_blank">Gutha</a></span>
, which is said to be quite distinct from ‚Äò good.‚Äô Whence then, one may ask, come your ideas, as associated with the fountain of all good, of omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence? Of course they are borrowed from <span class="place-name-romans"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romans" target="_blank">The Romans</a></span>
, who were <span class="place-name-pagans"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism" target="_blank">Pagans</a></span>
 like ourselves, and who, indeed, had much to learn from the <span class="place-name-ethiopians"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopians" target="_blank">Ethiopians</a></span>
 through <span class="place-name-greeks"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks" target="_blank">The Greeks</a></span>
.‚Äù</p>

 <p>A turn or two took the young men to <span class="place-name-russell-square"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Square" target="_blank">Russell Square</a></span>
, and soon they found themselves at Bedford Place. The darker man of the two produced a latch-key, and invited his companion to come in. There was nothing remarkable about the rooms except that they were furnished in the Oriental style. Here and there, at convenient corners, were divans with rich cushions, embroidered in silk, and carpets of leopard skins into which the feet sank as one walked. On the walls were trophies, consisting principally of African weapons. There were to be seen a collection of musical instruments of all descriptions, some so simple as to make one ' wonder how any symphony could be got out of them. A well-filled shelf, with a plain oak desk, littered with written matter, with some flowers here and there, about completed the outward circumstance of the room into which our visitor was ushered. Pushing well forward the only easy chair in the room, and placing his friend in it with a smile of welcome, he threw himself upon a low seat beside him, touched a bell on a side table, and ordered some refreshment.</p>

<p> ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt mind my old-world ways,‚Äù remarked <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúYou know, though I have lived in this country fairly long, off and on, I like to sniff a bit of the African air somehow where‚Äôer I go.‚Äù </p>

<p> ‚ÄúThat is perfectly natural, at least with a well-balanced mind,‚Äù correcting himself, said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; ‚Äúbut what I can‚Äôt understand is that you don‚Äôt seem a bit Eastern in your methods of work. To judge from that pile yonder,‚Äù eyeing the notes mischievously, ‚Äúone wouldn‚Äôt think you were over here for a holiday.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, that is only a bit of derivative work.</p>

<p>You have no idea how interesting it is. Would you like to see what -I am-doing ? ‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúHow good of you! I should be delighted.‚Äù ‚ÄúI shall soon be finishing now,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> excitedly. ‚ÄúYou see I am at the letter ‚Äò Y.‚Äô And that reminds me: you remember a while ago my taking you to task over the feebleness of the idear-of ‚Äò God‚Äô in ‚Äúthe Anglo-Saxon language. -I have just got the corresponding word here in Fanti. It is a big word, so big that you can hardly manage it :‚Äî </p>

<p>Nyiakropon.</p>

<p>Does it convey any meaning to you? How can it ? And yet, I can assure you, my friend, it is no mere barbarous jargon. It is the combination of distinct root ideas in one word. It relates back to the beginning of all things visible and links the intelligent part of man with the great Intelligence of the universe. Breaking up the word into its component parts, as I have done, we have:‚Äî </p>

<p>Nyia nu/ku ara oye, pon. That is, </p>
He who alone is great?'
 <p>‚ÄúHow very suggestive. Who should have thought it?‚Äù observed <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, enthusiastically. " Well, let us take the next word, then,</p>

 <p>Nyami, </p>

<p>which is still more suggestive, and analyse it. Broken up, it stands in bold relief thus :‚Äî </p>

<p>Nyia oye emi. That is, </p>

<p>He who is lam. </p>
<p>Now compare the <span class="place-name-hebrew"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew" target="_blank">Hebrew</a></span>
 lam hath sent me, and you have it. Nor is this a fanciful play upon roots, for our people sing unto this day:</p>
<p>‚ÄòWana si onyi Nyami se?</p>
<p>Dasayi wo ho inde, okina na onyi, </p>
<p>Nyami firi tsitsi kaisi odumankuma.‚Äô</p>
<p>meaning: </p>
<p>‚ÄòWho says he is equal with God?</p>
 			<p>Man is to-day, to-morrow he is not,</p>
 			<p>lam is from eternity to eternity.‚Äô </p>
<p>‚ÄúYou can now understand,‚Äù continued <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> in a low, sad tone, " why your difficulty surprised me. But now that I come to think of it, it may be due to the limitations of your language.' 	 " After what you have just shown me, I must confess there is a deal in what you say; and somehow you Orientals manage to keep your hold on the eternal verities, where we flounder and are lost.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúPardon me, my good friend, not quite that. As yet you are only drifting, drifting, drifting away from the ancient moorings that you Westerners built in sand. <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> came from the East. In <span class="place-name-bethlehem"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem" target="_blank">Bethlehem</a></span>
  he was born, and in <span class="place-name-egypt"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" target="_blank">Egypt</a></span>
 was he nurtured; and, yet, you seek to teach Him us. We have caught His Spirit and live; you follow the letter and are tossed hither and thither by every wind. Forgive me when I say that the future of ‚Äû the world is with the East. The nation that can, Ji in the next century, show the greatest output of spiritual strength, that is the nation that shall lead the world, and as <span class="personal-name-buddha"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha" target="_blank">Buddha</a></span>
 from <span class="place-name-africa"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" target="_blank">Africa</a></span>
 taught <span class="place-name-asia"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" target="_blank">Asia</a></span>
, so may Africa again lead the way.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI am not prepared to dispute the matter with you, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and there seems to be a good deal of truth in-what you say; but how about the doubt deep down in my own heart? That is a personal affair you know. In a word, what think you of the Christ ? ‚Äù</p>

<p> ‚ÄúWhat a clever dialectician you are, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, l to be sure? If_I_did not know you so well,  I would hardly think you were serious. You throw back to me the question I put to you a while ago, and you lay upon me the burden of solving my own riddle.‚Äù </p>

<p><span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs voice was low and sad with a suspicion of emotion in his whole manner, as he said: ‚ÄúForgive me, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> if I have seemed flippant; I was never more serious in my life. I have arrived at a crisis in my career which may mean disaster at any moment; and, what is more, until this day I have never had the courage to' speak it out to any of my friends for fear they would mock at my doubts.‚Äù</p>

 <p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> turned upon his friend a look full of penetration and sympathy; and, for the moment, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> felt uneasy under the searching glance of the Eastern student. It seemed to him as if in that instant <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had probed his inner nature and found it shallow. </p>

<p>According to our ideas, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, one broad (divinity runs through humanity, and whether we are gods, or we are men, depends upon how far we (nave given way to the divine influence operating upon our humanity; and, comparing one system with another, I must confess there was in the man Christ Jesus a greater share of divinity than in any teacher before or after Him, and that was in my mind when I was wondering what <span class="personal-name">Marcus Aurelius</span> <script src="scripts.js"> had in common with <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>.‚Äù </p>

<p> ‚ÄúBut tell me, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, supposing <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had been born of an Ethiopian woman instead of Mary of the line of David, do you think it would have made any difference in the way he influenced mankind? ‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat a strange question,‚Äù returned <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>; ‚Äúour Lord born of an Ethiopian woman?‚Äùforgetting his doubts for the moment‚Äî‚Äú Whatever put such an idea into your head? I am sure you are the first man who has given expression to such a thought.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, it is strange ‚Äù‚Äîand there was "a vibration of the intensest pathos in <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs voice  ‚Äî‚Äú that an African should venture to think that the Holy One of God might have been born of his I race. I can easily interpret your thoughts; but, I tell me, what is there extraordinary in the idea? " I " Oh, I don‚Äôt know. Habits of thought, convention, and all 'that sort of thing, I suppose. And yet I am hardly qualified to speak upon these things,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, softening.</p>

<p> He rose to go. He was due farther west to see his people. Before leaving, he laid a hand on <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs shoulder, and looking gravely into his face, he said: ‚ÄúIt is a pity, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I did not meet you a little earlier in my career. But even now, it may not be too late. Good-bye! Mind you meet me at <span class="place-name-liverpool-street-station"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Street_station" target="_blank">Liverpool Street Station</a></span>

                            <p> SILENCE prevailed in the room, except for the stitch, stitch, stitch, of a woman past the early bloom of womanhood who, at first stitching merely to pass away the time, now thrust, the needle j' viciously into the embroidery, as if bent upon ' drawing some secret from the heart of the silken cords of life.</p>

<p>Presently she began to cry‚Äîhot burning tears  which flowed from the passion of a heart which nought for rest and found none. </p>

<p>The curtains were down, and, save a glowing lire which a young student kept poking for no reason at all, the atmosphere of the room, as far ns these two souls were concerned, was in strange keeping with the fog outside. They were man and wife, these two, at least before God. Of his own free will he had made love to her in far away Africa, and she had responded. But that was years ago. She, then, a buxom, lively lass, he an intelligent youth of the National University. She, now in <span class="place-name-england"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" target="_blank">England</a></span>
, only a nurse-maid; he a successful student, equipped and ready to carry all the world before him. Yes, they were man and wife, these two; yet were they both ill at ease, and the young man would have willingly trusted himself to the tender mercies of‚Äîthe London fog. Yet he could not go. It was the law of compensation. He was fairly caught in his own meshes, and fate called upon him to face the music.</p>

<p>To do Tandor-Kuma justice, for that was the youth‚Äôs name, he had always intended to remain steadfast in his promise to <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. But now the circumstances were changed, and he was doing his best to grapple with a most difficult situation. How could he, a professional man, used to all the luxuries of English life and habit, take back with him to start a career in Africa a nurse-maid ? And what would he do, if asked to Government house? Thoughts such as these passed through his mind and-made him obdurate to the pleading of the woman a his feet.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúIf you cry again, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I shall leave you.  You know it is-too bad when I am doing all my best to amuse you in this horribly depressing weather.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, you needn‚Äôt trouble about that, Tandor- Kuma. I know you will leave me in any event. You don‚Äôt think I have lived all these years without knowing what you men are. You press weak women into your service, and when you have won their sympathy, for a dream you toss them away like this,‚Äù viciously kicking at the rug before the fire.
‚ÄúNow, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, try and be reasonable. You mustn‚Äôt think I am going to desert you. Bad as we men are, we have our ideals, and we never rest until we realise them.‚Äù
 ‚Äú Good! That beats all the cant I have ever heard! What is the next, pray? And women have no ideals, of course! Uncultured women do not feel, do not think! They are just like clay in the hands of you men to mould‚Äîto make or mar.‚Äù</p>

 <p>" Now you are getting angry. Let us discuss this matter dispassionately.‚Äù</p>

<p> Instead of that, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> burst into a paroxysm of grief which Tandor-Kuma found it hard to control. By degrees, she grew calmer, and, sticking a pin or two in her head-gear, she snatched up her wraps and stood ready to depart. " </p>

<p>Tandor-Kuma,‚Äù she said, " you have your ideals, and I have mine. Let us part like friends.  I shall not give you the opportunity of dismissing me like a cur. Good-bye, of the present! It may be we shall meet again.‚Äù And before the young student could frame a suitable answer, <span class="personal-name">Ekuba</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was gone. </p>

 <p>The Mfantsipim National University had, about the time that these studies open, been already doing good work- in Fanti-land. It had its origin in the national movement which swept over the country in the stormy- days of 1897, when the p Unpeople, as if moved by a sudden impulse, rallied round the Aborigines Society and successfully established the principle of land tenure under which the country has since thriven. </p>

<p>It had been felt for a long time by men of light and leading in Fanti-land that the Salvation of the people, depended upon education that to educate the youths of the country properly depended upon trained teachers; and that it was the work of a university to provide such training ground. </p>

<p>The people did not wait for endowments from the, rich and the philanthropic, or for money-making syndicates to start the work; but quickly collecting a few enthusiastic young men, these went about from province to province and from village to village trying to instil into the commonalty what the country lost by the neglect of education. The people began to understand and to talk about the matter in the wayside places. So that when Jubilee Day came round, and from province to province throughout all the states of Fanti-land the gong-gong of the Amanhin went round for contribution by the people to the National Educational Fund, great was the enthusiasm of high and low, and there was not a <span class="personal-name-hamlet"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" target="_blank">hamlet</a></span>
 throughout the land which did not send its fair share of contribution. Even the children threw into the Kruba in the market places their three- penny-bits. </p>

<p>Among the enthusiastic band who canvassed the educational question was <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and none more ardently than he. He was a man of remarkable intelligence, who, receiving the best education the schools of those days could afford, had, by hard work and natural taste for book- learning, so impressed the community with his ability that at the age of nineteen, he had been entrusted with the editorship of the national newspaper, and had already come to be regarded as one of the coming leaders of the people. </p>

<p>Upon the opening of the National University, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> gave up newspaper work and joined the University staff. He was foremost in bringing forward schemes to prevent the work of the University becoming a mere foreign imitation. He kept constantly before the Committee from the first the fact that no people could despise its own language, customs, and institutions and hope, to avoid national death. For that reason the distinctive garb of students, male and female, was national with an adaptability suggestive of the advanced state of society. It was recognised that the best part, of the teaching must be done in the people‚Äôs own language, and soon several text-books of known authority had, with the kind permission of authors and publishers, been translated into <span class="place-name-fanti"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fante_people" target="_blank">Fanti</a></span>
 thereby making the progress of the student rapid and sound. </p>

<p>The scheme involved, as it has been shown, the turning out of efficient teachers, and as the University was affiliated to that of London and in working correspondence with some of the best teaching institutions in <span class="place-name-japan"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" target="_blank">Japan</a></span>
, England, <span class="place-name-germany"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" target="_blank">Germany</a></span>
, and America, the work done was thorough. A young man or woman obtaining a certificate as a trained teacher- was sure of work in any part of the country at a recognised salary. Upon arriving in a province, all that the teacher would have to do would be to present his credentials to the Secretary for Education of the Omanhin, who, having a list of districts ready for a teacher, would at once introduce the new-comer. Generally he would find a suitable school house with all necessary appliances, but not the children; and he would be given to understand by the Committee that whether the schoolhouse remained empty or filled depended upon his own energy and the interest he brought into his work, and, what was more, his rise to the maximum stipend would be the result of the maximum success expected. As if a rule, the teachers were men who had their heart  in their work, and the filling of the schools was a matter of two or three months,</p>

<p>The thirst for knowledge spread so rapidly that men and women took to attending night schools where they quickly picked up reading and writing in their own language, and such was the general eagerness for learning that translation work had become a distinct feature of the work of the University. Hence at the time that he made the acquaintance of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, he was engaged upon derivative work in London. His health having given way somewhat as the result of excessively hard work, he had been recommended to go away for a bit, and taking advantage of the opportunity, he had visited Japan, Germany, and America to study their methods, winding up, as he planned out in his own mind, with a visit to England. </p>

<p>By this time the outlook of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> upon life was broadening; and the young man was beginning to cast in his mind the most useful avenue by which his life‚Äôs work could be best accomplished. While he thought upon these things, that Divinity which shapes our ends, whether we understand or no, was shaping matters in a way for <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> that he could hardly anticipate. By a resolution of the University authorities, while in London, an offer came to him to continue his-stay for a period of three years certain, for the purpose of superintending the publications of several standard works in the vernacular that the University had arranged to bring out. When the offer came, he at once closed with it, seeing therein a way to the fixing of his future career. And so the die was cast. Having private means of his own, he joined the <span class="place-name-university-of-cambridge"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a></span>
 read jurisprudence for a year, and having then joined the <span class="place-name-inner-temple"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Temple" target="_blank">Inner Temple</a></span>
, had, at the time that we met him along <span class="place-name-tottenham-court-road"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Court_Road" target="_blank">Tottenham Court Road</a></span>
 in the company of <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, settled down in London to read law in grim earnest. </p>


2.
 <p>In the far-away home in Africa, where <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was born and bred, he had known, a little orphan girl who attracted attention I wherever she went by her simple, unaffected ways. She must have been under the ministration of some <span class="place-name-guardian-angel"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_angel" target="_blank">Guardian Angel</a></span>
, for if ever a person grew in favour with the gods and men, it was she. Daily she was to be seen in the temples of Nanamu, and no one was more attentive, or worried the old priest afterwards with such knotty questions. She was born well, and, having passed through a course in the University, was now visiting Europe for the first time to put the finishing touches to her education. </p>

 <p>When <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> parted with <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, the latter made his way to <span class="place-name-holborn"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holborn" target="_blank">Holborn</a></span>
and wandered aimlessly down <span class="place-name-oxford-street"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Street" target="_blank">Oxford Street</a></span>
, his mind full of varied thoughts. He had always been a thinker, and this morning in his conversation with <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> fresh avenues of thought had opened up in his mind which he wished to pursue undisturbed. As he watched the mighty procession of men, women, and children jostling one another, he was overwhelmed with a sense of the weariness which European civilisation had evolved for itself. But it was of the teaching of the <span class="place-name-christian-philosophy"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_philosophy" target="_blank">Christian philosophy</a></span>
 and its paradoxes that his mind was full. Was it not the Nazarene who said: "Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give rest ‚Äù ? Had he given this people, who professed to be his followers, rest in their constant attempt to overreach one another, in the way they trampled upon- one another unto fame and fortune? Again, he had called all his followers brethren, and was not his the injunction to go forth and teach all nations that all might be brethren? And, even now, the words of '<span class="personal-name"> Silas Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, Divinity scholar of Queen‚Äôs: ‚ÄúWhat a strange question! Our Lord born of an Ethiopian woman! "‚Äîagain rang in his ears. What if <span class="personal-name-bishop"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop" target="_blank">Bishop</a></span>
, prelates, in the direct line of Him, Who made Himself of no reputation, felt the same, and I yet dared to "propagate his gospel among the Ethiopian Gentiles? Were there to" paradoxes all the way through? A religion which taught one thing, and practised another, was it worth following? And in his inmost heart he found himself thanking the gods that he was a poor benighted pagan according to the formula of the Church. </p>

<p>In the frame of mind in which <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was, he was in no temper to be disturbed; but as , luck would have it, he had not gone far when he saw coming towards him a dark man, known among his fellows as the Professor. He professed all things and knew nothing in particular. He was in reality Kwow Ayensu, a student of several years‚Äô standing at the <span class="place-name-charing-cross-hospital"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charing_Cross_Hospital" target="_blank">Charing Cross Hospital</a></span>
, to whom, as far as one could judge, the question of a medical or a surgical diploma was of a secondary consideration. <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> dodged the Professor and made for the opposite pavement. The Professor as promptly crossed over, and familiarly tapping him on the shoulder, said in a gruff voice, ‚ÄúHallo! old fellow, how are you? I have not seen you for quite an age; and what is the meaning of cutting an old chum like this, eh? ‚Äù</p>

<p>Evidently there was no getting away from the Professor, and so <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> resigned himself to his fate. ‚ÄúThe fact is,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúif you want me to be frank with you, I wanted to be alone. I was so enjoying myself before you interrupted me I love to observe without being observed.‚Äù</p>

 <p>"Do you include in your observations that of humanity in general ?‚Äù dryly put in the Professor. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúTo me it is the most interesting study, and the best theatre I find to be these very pavements, the performers being the moving throng of men and women. To study humanity in this guise is to me the acme of intellectual pastime, and much as I would like a chat with you another time, I am really sorry you disturbed me.‚Äù " Your case,‚Äù said the Professor, ‚Äúis a simple one of cerebral contraction of the sympathies come with me, old boy, to the <span class="place-name-argyle-rooms"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyle_Rooms" target="_blank">Argyle Rooms</a></span>
 to night, and I warrant you the finest study of humanity anywhere in London. You may notice without being noticed, and if you should fee inclined to thaw, by Jove you will have your world cut out. Some of the latest arrivals are rare bits and they-are-the rage of all the young hounds misnamed-mem Do come with me.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúI thank you for the kind invitation, but I am afraid I cannot come to the Argyle Rooms with you to-night, as I must catch the night train to <span class="place-name-cambridge"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge" target="_blank">Cambridge</a></span>
 with a friend.‚Äù</p>

<p>"Well, then, come with me to the York Hotel instead. It may be I shall be able to interest you, and, if you please, you may stand me a treat after. I hear some of you ‚Äôvarsity chaps are very good that way. Your average rusty London student does not understand champagne suppers and that kind of thing.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúIf it comes to that, Professor, we needn‚Äôt go all the way to the York Hotel. We can just drop in at Slater‚Äôs round the corner, and I will warrant you as good-a-lunch as you ever tasted. Come along now I will take no refusal.‚Äù </p>

<p>It did not take much to persuade the Professor, and together they were soon seated at a well- appointed table in a comfortable corner. After lunch the Professor said to <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚ÄúOne good turn deserves another. I thought I would give you a bit of a surprise, but since the mountain would not come to Mahomet, I suppose he must go to it. The fact is, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> is in London, and is staying at the York Hotel with her father.‚Äù</p>


 3.
 <p>When <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> called at the hotel the next day to pay his respects he was surprised to learn that, an hour or so previously, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> and her father had taken the train for <span class="place-name-harwich"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harwich" target="_blank">Harwich</a></span>
on their way to the Continent. The girl had always expressed a desire to see the principal countries of Europe, and as her father had a little business in the south of Germany, she had coaxed him, on the plea that it yet wanted a fortnight before she would be due to enter college, to take her with him. So pleased she was with her German surroundings, that when her father was returning to London, she was loth to come with him; and as she had always shown a decided inclination for music, it had been decided she should remain at school there for a year or two to pursue her studies. Time passed and <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> had no news of <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. All the Professor could tell him was that her father had returned to Africa, and the young lady was pursuing her studies on the Continent. </p>

 <p>In the meanwhile, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was quietly reading in the Temple. They were eventful years‚Äîthose three short years in the heart of the metropolis. The science of jurisprudence had always attracted him. It opened to him vistas of justice and fair play between man and man, which strongly appealed to him. The influence of the stoical writings over the Roman jurists, producing a Law of Nations, showed him a way by which the nations of the-earth, yielding to higher impulses, might mete out justice to the weak races of mankind. Moreover, the opportunity which it gave him of comparing the institutions and customs of his own country with other systems was an endless source of delight to him. Now was his opportunity to fit himself for the battle of life. He read, not for examinations, but for information. He drank freely from the vital springs of knowledge and found his soul satisfied. He could not help feeling that he had a call to duty, and that in the service of his race.
At the time of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> being called to the Bar he had invited to London for a day his friend <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. After the ceremony they repaired to the Haymarket to hear <span class="personal-name-mr-beerbohm-tree"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerbohm_Tree" target="_blank">Mr. Beerbohm Tree</a></span>
in the part of <span class="personal-name">Hamlet</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. As the curtain did not rise till 8.30, and the evening was particularly fine, they walked down to the theatre from the Temple, and the conversation naturally turned upon Shakespeare‚Äôs masterpiece. </p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, I have never forgotten the conversation you and I had three winters ago along Tottenham Court Road, and I have been going deeply into the matter. I have been comparing the worship of <span class="personal-name-osiris"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris" target="_blank">Osiris</a></span>
 by the Egyptians of your own race, the <span class="place-name-akkadian"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language" target="_blank">Akkadian</a></span>
 philosophy, the religions of <span class="personal-name-zoroaster"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster" target="_blank">Zoroaster</a></span>
, of <span class="personal-name-buddha"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha" target="_blank">Buddha</a></span>
, and of <span class="personal-name-confucius"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius" target="_blank">Confucius</a></span>
, the teachings of the <span class="place-name-greek-mysteries"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_religion" target="_blank">Greek mysteries</a></span>
, and of the <span class="place-name-stoic-writings"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoic_philosophy" target="_blank">Stoic writings</a></span>
, and the farther I have gone into the matter the more puzzled I have become as to the right of the people calling themselves Christians to a monopoly of <span class="place-name-divine-light"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divine_light" target="_blank">Divine light</a></span>
. And as to the term ‚Äò<span class="personal-name-heathen"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heathen" target="_blank">Heathen</a></span>
,‚Äô I think it I arrogant for any devotee of any one sect to apply it to another. There is as much sense in it as the <span class="place-name-ancient-greeks"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_Greeks" target="_blank">Ancient Greeks</a></span>
 dubbing all others <span class="place-name-barbarians"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian" target="_blank">barbarians</a></span>
. Here we are to-night, for instance, going to hear a play written by one <span class="personal-name-william-shakespeare"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" target="_blank">William Shakespeare</a></span>
, a Christian gentleman, who flourished in the reign of <span class="personal-name-queen-elizabeth"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth" target="_blank">Queen Elizabeth</a></span>
. I dare say if I stood in the pit of the Haymarket to-night, and made an open statement that<span class="personal-name"> William Shakespeare </span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>was a gentleman, but I had my doubts as to whether he was a Christian, I would be hooted down and hissed out of the theatre. Yet a superficial reading of some of his works will convince you that his sentiments, if he wrote from his inmost self, which he must have done, great poet as he was, were far from those of a Christian. See how <span class="personal-name">Hamlet</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> nurses in his bosom a feeling of revenge so poignant as to find satisfaction killing the wicked king only at a moment when he will fall with, all his sins upon his head. It reads like the work of a heathen, and yet I dare not--suggest that <span class="personal-name"> William Shakespeare </span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>was a heathen at heart." <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> burst into a hearty laugh. " </p>

<p>Unless you have read Jevon to little purpose, you must admit that that argument is faulty. Yet I cannot help- agreeing with you that the word ‚Äòheathen' is a relative term, and perhaps your average Englishman has no right to call the average Ethiopian heathen.  Ours was the <span class="place-name-cradle-of-civilization"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization" target="_blank">Cradle of Civilization</a></span>
, and that it had not the permanence I that the <span class="place-name-christian-civilization"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_civilization" target="_blank">Christian civilization</a></span>
 is likely to have does not make it any the less a civilisation; and I, for one, feel nothing but pity for the kind of ignorance which scoffs at what it does not understand.‚Äù </p>

<p>The speaker stopped somewhat abruptly and eyed the listener curiously. After a second, he continued:</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know perfectly well, my good friend, that I am not a Christian. If not, what am I?. Perhaps delicacy may forbid you saying what you think. But, believe me, I am not ashamed to be called pagan, or heathen, or by any other such pet word. With all due respect to <span class="personal-name-st-paul"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul" target="_blank">St. Paul</a></span>
, we worship that we do know. The fact of the case is, that from the days of the great teachers of Christianity you Christians have not taken the trouble to understand any other system but your own.‚Äù</p>

<p> "You know, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, turning off the subject, I have taken my degree, and I am soon due for ordination,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. " But all these years the reason and the faith within me have been in such deadly conflict as to leave my senses reeling. Yet the die is cast; I have given my name into the Bishop; I cannot look back for fear of breaking my mother‚Äôs heart.‚Äù '</p>

 <p>‚Äò‚ÄòI am sorry for you, my dear friend,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúbut, perhaps, you don‚Äôt look at the matter from the broad point of view that an outsider can look at it. I know, of course, something of the religions of the past. I have studied our" own Eastern systems and compared them with the system you Westerns have adopted, and find that one broad divinity as well as humanity runs through them all. You will grant, I think, that there was something that lifted man to God in all the systems you have named, and in others of which, as yet, you know nothing, and that some of the founders of these systems, such as <span class="personal-name-epictetus"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus" target="_blank">Epictetus</a></span>
, <span class="personal-name-cleanthes"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanthes" target="_blank">Cleanthes</a></span>
, Buddha <span class="personal-name-gautama"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" target="_blank">Gautama</a></span>
, were men whose ideals of self-suppression and communion with God were of no mean order. I am free to say that there is a marked difference between them all and the Christ, as much as there -is a difference between the stoical -writings and the <span class="place-name-gospel-of-st-john"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John" target="_blank">Gospel of St. John</a></span>
. <span class="personal-name">Jesus Christ</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was a living, breathing, God- in-man personality, linking human son-ship with <span class="place-name-divine-fatherhood"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Fatherhood" target="_blank">Divine Fatherhood</a></span>
. Buddha Gautama, for example, never truly realised his own son-ship with God as to reveal that relationship to man. He - strove to pierce the secret of the universe, but never quite succeeded. Then as to reason and faith and the load of doubt‚Äîwell, if you ask me whether the birth of Jesus 'Christ was a natural birth or a supernatural one, as an outsider, all I can say is, I don‚Äôt know, nor does it matter one jot whether it was the one or the other. Similarly, if you ask me whether He did ascend into Heaven with His bodily form, defying the <span class="place-name-law-of-gravitation"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation" target="_blank">Law of Gravitation</a></span>
, I say I don‚Äôt know, nor does it matter. But this I do know, that His life and work and His interpretation of the ways of- God with man may so draw one to Him as brother, friend, master, and, through Him, to God as Father, <span class="place-name-almighty-sovereign"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almighty" target="_blank">Almighty Sovereign</a></span>
, Benefactor and Guide, and that should be enough for the average man whose object is not arrogantly to question high Heaven, but to make his way thither humbly and piously.‚Äù </p>

<p>When they arrived at the theatre the curtain was just up, and, for a moment, they were engrossed in the simple setting of the play for which Mr. Beerbohm Tree is so remarkable in his Shakespearean representations. In Scene III., where Polonius utters the precept: " Beware of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in, bear‚Äôt that the opposed may beware of thee,‚Äù <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, poking his t friend in the rib, whispered, ‚ÄúThat is Christian sentiment with a vengeance.‚Äù</p>

<p> When the curtain next went up, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> drew the attention of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> to a bevy of dark girls with an elderly man, who seemed to be playing the part of <span class="place-name-chaperon"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperon" target="_blank">Chaperon</a></span>
, and who were soon joined by a couple of young men. <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> followed the direction indicated by <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, and nearly jumped out of his seat with excitement.
 "What is it, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>?‚Äù asked <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. " You generally are so cool.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúPardon me, but the fact is, I must introduce you at once. Those are my friends the <span class="personal-name">Abans</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> and I am very much mistaken if the young lady at the corner is not Miss <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. Come along!‚Äù And he literally dragged <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> after him. </p>

<p>The old gentleman saw the twain coming in their direction, and beamed all over with delight. He was a good-hearted soul, and loved to see the sons of Ethiopia acquit themselves honourably in a strange land, and he had heard nothing but what was good of <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. The enthusiasm with which <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was greeted by his friends struck <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> forcibly, and he did not at all notice the few seconds that passed before he was introduced. </p>

<p>During the interval, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, who hated all crushes, preferred to remain where she was, so <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> fetched her some refreshment, and stayed to talk to her.
‚ÄúSo you deserted us for the Continent without a moment‚Äôs notice. It was really bad of you, and I hope you have made up your mind now to make full amends.‚Äù</p>

 <p>"Yes, I didn‚Äôt like the life here,‚Äù said <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúSomehow it didn‚Äôt suit me. Besides, I had no friends here, and as my father was going away, I felt I could not stay.‚Äù	</p>

<p> "You must have found <span class="place-name-stuttgart"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart" target="_blank">Stuttgart</a></span>
 congenial, to judge from the length of time you have been away. Your father has been telling me a little about it, and I hoped to hear more from you.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúOh! that must be another time. See, the curtain is about to rise, and here come trooping in the <span class="personal-name">Abans</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. You know we arrived only this afternoon by the <span class="place-name-dover"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover" target="_blank">Dover</a></span>
 train, and met the <span class="personal-name">Abans</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> at the hotel; and as they were coming to see <span class="personal-name">Hamlet</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, my father thought it would be nice for us to come with them.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúNow, that reminds me, by a stroke of ill-luck, I arrived at your hotel the day you left for the Continent half an hour too late, to find the bird had flown.‚Äù
<span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> felt a little confused; and just then the curtain rose. </p>

<p>The rest of the play interested <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> little, and he was not at all sorry when cheer after cheer called Mr. Tree over and over again before the footlights to receive such an ovation as few artists have received before or since.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúMind you call before I leave for Africa,‚Äù said the old gentleman, as <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> and <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> said good-night.</p>

<p> The friends talked little on their way back to the Temple, and <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, divining what was passing in his friend‚Äôs mind, respected his silence.! ' Before separating for the night, however, <span class="personal-name">Whitely</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> said, ‚ÄúAllow me, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, to thank you for giving me such an agreeable evening in such a Cultured company. Your friends, by Jove, are a credit to Africa, and it makes me feel inclined to lead a crusade against narrowness and prejudice.‚Äù </p>

<p> ‚ÄúThank you so much. I am glad you think so well of my friends. I hope you will sleep well after all the day‚Äôs dissipation.‚Äù This, as <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> showed his friend to his room. </p>


4.
<p>For the next few weeks, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> and <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> saw a good deal of one another. From the first, there was a congeniality between the two which went to make all intercourse natural, pleasant, and spontaneous. It was as if they had known one another all their lives; and it seemed the most natural thing that henceforth their joint lives should run in the same tenor. One day, as the twain sat chatting over an afternoon cup of tea, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> fetched a letter from a writing-table and, carelessly spreading it out, said: </p>

<p>‚ÄúI forgot to tell you, when last you were here, that I have been offered the post of head-mistress of the junior classes of our home university. I am sure you will be delighted with the idea, for I am going to accept it, and my father agrees with me.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can you think of such a thing?‚Äù burst out <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> almost indignantly. </p>

<p>His manner was so sudden that <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> could not possibly control herself. </p>

<p>‚ÄúNow, what have I done to call for such sharp treatment? ‚Äù she demanded firmly, yet playfully. </p>

<p>‚ÄúForgive me, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, if I have spoken with unwonted heat, only I was thinking‚Äîwell, I was thinking you might teach me instead.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúWhat an absurd idea! How can I teach such a big, strapping fellow like you? "said <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>. ‚ÄúBesides, you are so clever. Surely, you mock me.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúBelieve me, my dear child,‚Äù and there was a slight tremor in the manly voice, ‚ÄúI was never more in earnest in my life.‚Äù</p>

<p> <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> seemed puzzled. After a little hesitation, she said: </p>

<p>"You call me ‚Äòchild,‚Äô and yet you would have me believe that I can teach you. Can you be serious? ‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I am quite serious. ‚ÄòAnd a little child shall lead them,‚Äô ‚Äù he quoted. " I was hoping,‚Äù pursued <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, ‚Äúthat yours would be the task to teach me the way of duty, and that, when found, you would help me to tread it.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúBut how do I know what your duty is ? Who can tell better than yourself ? Moreover, the gods of our fathers can teach you it, if you need guidance. Don‚Äôt you know that, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>? ‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I know that. But this also I do know, that the gods are wont to make use of human instruments in approaching men. The Infinite finds expression in the finite, and the ideal is realised in the actual. And it has often occurred to me that the child-like hand that shall guide me through life‚Äôs labyrinthine ways is the self-same one that I now hold tenderly in my own.‚Äù </p>

 <p>She began to understand. She made an effort as if she would withdraw her hand. She hesitated, and the next moment she surrendered the other also.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúYou will be my teacher, then? "asked <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, half-persuasively, half-triumphantly. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she simply answered. ‚ÄúSo may the gods of our race help me‚Äù.</p>

<p>As the days passed, the twain grew in that mutual understanding, the true basis of all happy unions. Now and again he would tell her of his prospects, which he laughingly said were nil, having inherited little else beyond a clear head and a willing heart for work, with which he hoped they would be able to forge their way in life together; to which <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> would sweetly say that she wished she had a fortune to make things easy, but since she had it not, she would bring him the next best, a loyal heart and true, at which <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> would chide her, and say that was the best of all. </p>

<p>Little by little, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> told <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> all that had happened in her little life since the days he knew her as a child of ten.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she said, talking to him one day, ‚ÄúI often invoked Nanamu that I might be permitted to travel to see a little bit of the world, and it seemed they heard me; for soon after, my father took it into his head to visit Europe with me after I had successfully passed my examinations at our university. When we arrived here, the life of the people seemed to me artificial. Perhaps I could not have expressed my feeling then in those words, but, anyhow, I felt as if I was not in my proper element. Chance took me to Germany. I found things very different there‚Äîthere, in the <span class="place-name-black-forest"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest" target="_blank">Black Forest</a></span>
, I got into direct touch with Nature; the song of the birds, the bleating of the lambs, the fragrance of the fields, all seemed so natural, and I said to myself: Here is my proper place; here the atmosphere wherein my nature may expand. The rest you know. And now, what think you of the result? "</p>

<p>For answer, <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> caressingly drew her nearer to his side. </p>

<p>Summer was waning into autumn, and the chrysanthemum and the sweet mignonette were in bloom, when the lovers decided upon marriage before returning to Africa, where <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was to start a practice. It was to be a simple affair, at which there were to be no bride‚Äôs-maids or groom‚Äôs-men, and only the nearest friends were to be asked. <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> appeared in church on the wedding-day in a simple African costume of her own design, tastefully got up, and when someone asked her the reason for her choice, she said she knew it would please her husband, and, besides, it answered best to her own conception of what was proper. And, ‚Äúso, these were wed,‚Äô‚Äô to employ <span class="personal-name-tennyson"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred,_Lord_Tennyson" target="_blank">Tennyson</a></span>
‚Äôs words.</p>

 <p><span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script> was not long in taking up the duties of life in grim earnest with his dear little , wife to cheer and to comfort him. From the first success smiled upon them, either as the result of honest, strenuous effort, coupled with natural ability, or as a mark of the favour of the gods, or both. Gradually they built up a big practice, and by the time their little boy was able to toddle from room to room, and call ‚ÄúFadder! Mudder!" they had a sweet little home of their own, with plenty of flowers, and sunshine, and love, and God‚Äôs blessing. Five short, very short, happy years of mutual love and association, and then there came; a cloud which, for the moment, seemed to <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>‚Äôs breaking heart and tearful eyes without the silver lining; for, with the advent of their second born, a sweet baby girl, <span class="personal-name">Mansa</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>, poor wife L and mother, paid with her life for that of her child, who, as though she could not stand the gloom she had brought to this once bright home, soon joined her mother, and made the former gloom twice gloomier, and father and son were alone with a twice two-fold bond of love between their souls and the souls of those that had gone before. </p>

<p>And when his little boy of three asked <span class="personal-name">Kwamankra</span> <script src="scripts.js"></script>: ‚ÄúWhere is ‚ÄòMudder?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere is Sissie?‚Äù he would say : ‚Äú ‚Äò Mudder' is gone to God, or Sissie is gone to God,‚Äù as the case might be, and would turn aside his face, lest his little one might know the full extent of their woe.</p>
