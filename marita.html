                <div class="author-info">
                    <h3>Author Biography</h3>
                    <p>The author of Marita or the Folly of Love employed the pseudonym ‚ÄúA Native‚Äù to signal that the work was authored by an indigenous inhabitant of the Gold Coast colony. This pseudonymous authorship is widely interpreted as a strategic decision, given the critical stance the novel adopts toward colonial governance and societal norms. Scholarly opinion remains divided regarding the true identity of the author. While several researchers‚Äîincluding Jenkins (1985), Baku (1987), and Gocking (1999)‚Äîattribute the work to J. E. Casely Hayford, others have challenged this attribution. Yitah and Dako, for example, assert that "A. Native was an erudite scholar" (362) and, based on a close analysis of the text‚Äôs language, imagery, and stylistic features, contend that James Hutton Brew, rather than Casely Hayford, authored the novel (Yitah and Dako 362)</p>.


                  <p>The intellectual elite of the Gold Coast, driven by a desire for self-representation and public discourse, frequently engaged in literary and political writing across various periodicals. However, due to the subversive or anti-colonial tone of many of these writings, they were often excluded from mainstream colonial publications such as The Gold Coast Times and The Gold Coast Press. In response, James Hutton Brew established The Western Echo, a private newspaper based in Abura Dunkwa, which later became known as The Gold Coast Echo. This publication provided a vital platform for the Gold Coast intelligentsia to circulate their ideas through essays, fictional narratives, and serialized novels. Notably, Marita or the Folly of Love was serialized in this newspaper across approximately forty installments between 1885 and 1888.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>‚ÄòSo my dear friend, yon have gone and done it; I am surprised and astonished at you, I certainly gave you
                more credit for a good share of common sense, and sufficient knowledge of the world. Is it possible, and
                can it be true that it was yours the banns, that was published in the chapel yesterday?‚Äô This was
                uttered by a man of about forty five years, strong but slenderly built, and of middle stature;
                complexion sallow red, his eyes were keen but yet seldom look you twice in the face, and his features
                regular. His manners were grave, but a more jovial and sincere friend never lived. In his youth he had
                the advantage of the best English education; besides being a good Latin, Greek and Hebrew scholar. <span
                        class="personal-name">Bonsoe Penin</span>, the name of this gentleman, was not a bachelor, yet
                he was married, he had several wives; two he had living with him in his own house; the rest lived in
                their own houses, and it is strange to say that he lived happily with them all.</p>


            <p>Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, the hero of this tale, was a man who had just entered his
                fortieth year short and slenderly built, healthy and strong. His features were not different from any of
                his countrymen‚Äôs - real type of a negro. He also had the advantage of English education, moved in the
                highest society, both European and native, and at the time that this tale was commenced he was filling a
                post -which was worth to him several hundred pounds sterling a year.</p>

            <p>These two gentlemen were fast friends, so strong was their friendship that not a day passed but what you
                would see them together. No wonder therefore that Mr <span class="personal-name">Bonsoe Penin</span>
                used such familiar terms to his friend <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòGently, <span class="personal-name">Bonsoe Penin</span>,‚Äô replied <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, ‚ÄòNot -so fast. Take a seat and cool yourself with a glass of
                Moselle and soda before you attempt to talk, as you are burning with heat. It is thus that I punish you
                for your hard words. After you have rested we will find time to talk about the matter and any amount of
                nonsense you like.‚Äô </p>

            <p> ‚ÄòBy ‚Äî ! <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> you are really provoking! I swear that 1 will not sit
                down, nor allow myself to be insulted by your offer of drink until you have satisfied me. Was the banns
                published yours and Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>‚Äôs?‚Äô replied <span
                        class="personal-name-3"><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span></span> persistently.
            </p>

            <p> ‚ÄòYes, <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>, are you satisfied now? or rather, are you in
                such a state as would admit of your taking a ‚Äúshot‚Äù now before talking.‚Äô </p>

            <p><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> here took a seat on the other side of the table at
                which he met his friend sitting and writing his books. Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>
                called for a bottle of Moselle and two of soda and glasses. The boy took off the wines, placed the
                bottles on the tables and then retired leaving the two friends to enjoy themselves. ‚ÄòHow clumsy you are
                today <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>‚Äô, exclaimed <span
                        class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> getting up suddenly. ‚ÄòBy Jove! you have wet me all
                over. On my clean shirt and collar! and I am due the court in twenty minutes time, and His Honour the
                Chief Justice is so provokingly punctual! Where the d‚Äî am I going to get a change of shirt? And the
                court is fully 15 minutes ride from here. I wish I never allowed myself to be tempted by this accursed
                drink. What must I do, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>?‚Äô </p>

            <p>I will lend you a shirt, old fellow and a dozen collars if you like,‚Äô replied <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> laughing. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòPooh, man your shirt wont fit me, it will choke me. I will none of your babyish shirts, especially in
                court and to-day too when I have to defend a poor murderer and have to do all I can to save the poor
                man‚Äôs innocent neck from coming into close proximity with the hangman‚Äôs noose.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòNo, no, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, I would rather play truant to-day from Court and
                endure his Honour‚Äôs reprimand tomorrow than lose my client‚Äôs cause, which I would certainly do were I to
                go to Court to-day with your shirt on.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòBoy! boy!‚Äô called Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> to his servant; ‚Äòbring another bottle of
                Moselle. I must say <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>, if your ‚Äúlearned self,‚Äù instead
                of apparel, had shown such a great aptitude for drinking to-day I would certainly be glad. See there is
                not a drop of wine left in the bottle and we are still dry. You will open the second bottle, and after
                we have had our first shot you will indite a letter to His Honour to postpone the hearing of your case
                until tomorrow; after which we will have time to talk freely and uninterruptedly.‚Äô </p>

            <p><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> here upon indited a letter to His Honour assigning
                other reasons than that which was the true cause of his inability to attend the Court; and after
                despatching it by his own boy, sat down minus coat as contented as if no mishap had taken place and the
                two friends commenced talking seriously together</p>.

                            <p>We must now leave these two gentlemen, and introduce the heroine of this tale to the reader. Miss <span
                    class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, at the time that this tale commenced was a woman of about
                four and twenty years old; in stature she was short, but proportionably well built; she was neither
                stout nor thin, although she had a tendency towards stoutness. Her features were not very regular but
                extremely pleasing; her gait or steps were faultless, and she has a way of carrying herself among her
                own class ‚Äî the uneducated women ‚Äî that she is everywhere considered to be equal if not superior to any
                of her companions. It is only in company of educated ladies that she exhibits a consciousness of
                inferiority. Coupled with these natural advantages she has a strong and well regulated mind which wanted
                only education to have made her perfect. In fact she was a woman gifted by nature to adorn any (XP
                society if she had been cultured. Was it to be wondered at that Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> became fascinated by her even in spite of her want of
                education, and the occasional burst of temper which she exhibited. Love is blind, and in the case of Mr
                <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> as well as Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>‚Äôs,
                <span class="personal-name-cupid"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid"
                                                     target="_blank">Cupid</a></span> never played a severer trick upon
                two fools. </p>

            <p>Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> had
                lived as man and wife for more than eight years, enjoying all the, blessings of married life. Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> showed the same amount of respect for his lady as he would
                have shown had their marriage been solemnized in the Church. He stuck to her alone and would on no
                account take or keep any other woman. Every lady respected her as if a minister had joined them together
                in holy wedlock. Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> on her part honoured and above all
                obeyed Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> in every thing and at all times. She felt great
                interest in her good man‚Äôs affairs, which she in every way considered as her own. In fact, no two
                persons that have been united together by the church could have lived more happily together than those
                two who were only married by country marriage,10 a marriage looked down upon as debasing and degrading.
            </p>

            <p> I may add that although Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and his wife attended chapel and
                were <span class="personal-name-christians"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians"
                                                               target="_blank">Christians</a></span>, nominally, since
                they were not class members," yet the gentleman through reasons of his own would never be induced to
                attend class meetings. As for the lady she never knew what it was, until Mrs <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> the minister's wife and her husband who was a friend of
                Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> thought it a duty incumbent upon them to endeavour to
                convert her. They accordingly got her to enter her name in the class list, and in course of time was
                baptized and duly became a member of the <span class="place-name-wesleyan"><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesleyan_theology" target="_blank">Wesleyan</a></span> body;
                Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> seeing no fault in the step having given his consent
                thereto previously. From that day things began to wear a different aspect; Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> visibly changed. What delighted her before became sin in
                her eyes. Those innocent and harmless pleasures that used to amuse her were considered by her as sinful;
                she became moody, discontented and restless. She would, for hours, go to the minister‚Äôs house and come
                home looking as if something was troubling her mind. To Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>‚Äôs
                inquiries as to her change of conduct and behaviour, she would reply ‚Äònothing.‚Äô In the meantime Rev: Mr
                <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> became assiduous in pressing Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> to become a class member, as [Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> had been, and that it only wanted that to make <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> and himself happy in their marriage life. Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> could not well see through that, for had he not lived with
                his wife more than eight years happily and in the most agreeable manner? From that day he saw and deeply
                felt that the heart of his lady as well as her love and affections had been taken away from him, and by
                a certain mistaken notion of christian religion. Henceforward he must make up his mind to lead a
                miserable life with her he loved, unless he turned her away at once or became a class member himself.
                Things were in this state when a European minister arrived who took charge of the station and Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> became his assistant. Rev Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-19">Powers</span> and Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> became
                friends, and in a short time their friendship developed into intimacy. Religion formed principally the
                subject of their conversation; and after a time Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> was induced
                to promise and ultimately become a class member, having for leader his friend Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>. </p>

            <p>If his obstinacy to be a class member was the cause of the change of con- duct in Miss <span
                    class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had cause to
                rejoice when he enrolled his name as a member of the Wesleyan Society; for the same spirit of
                contentment, love and happiness that ruled in their domestic hearth before Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> became a member returned and they lived happily together
                again. But the two ministers had not finished with them yet. <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>
                must give to his wife a ring through a minister, before God and in the open chapel; in fine they must
                enter into the ‚ÄòHoly state of matrimony‚Äô before they could be admitted as full members of the society.
                In for a penny, in for a pound. The lady was willing, her people were willing; <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had to consult nobody, and there was ‚Äòno just cause or
                impediment‚Äô why he also should not be willing; for had he not lived for several years happily together
                with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>? Before God, Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> conscientiously considered Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> legally his wife although no minister had married them. He
                had not the least doubt that God, the searcher of hearts considered them as man and wife; and if it only
                wanted the mere putting on of a ring on the part of the woman to make their marriage legal in the eyes
                of men, well, he must conform to it: and the announcement of their banns was accordingly published in
                the Sunday previous to the day Bonsoe Pennin called on his friend Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> in the great trepidation and astonishment mentioned at the
                opening of this chapter. </p>

                of his friend. I seldom see her lately; she used to call very often at my house to see her friends; but
                it seems to me that she avoids the place now. What can be the matter, <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>?‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòI really do not know;‚Äô replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu:</span> ‚Äòunless because she is now a
                class member, and the duty attached to her spiritual concerns gives hei no time to call. Mrs D your wife
                was here the day before yesterday, and remained several hours with her chatting together.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòDo you really mean,‚Äô asked <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> in astonishment, ‚Äòthat Miss
                <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> is now a class member? and who is her leader?‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòI mean not only to tell you that <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> is a member,‚Äô returned

            <p>This news, true as it was, did not a little startle Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>.
                For some minutes he could not open his mouth, but sat down in the utmost astonishment, looking at his
                friend. At last ne said: </p>

            <p>‚ÄòWords fail me to express my sentiments; allow me to congratulate you. I must candidly say, however, that

            <p> Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> was, in the utmost degree, 'perplexed; he saw that his
                darling structure was tottering; the axe which Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>
                wielded so well was doing all possible mischief to his enchanted edifice, and unless he made some
                desperate stand he would find his sweet hopes of unalloyed happiness in the new marriage scattered to

                afterwards embraced, compelled them to take unto themselves new wives and marry them according to the
                Church. In their hearts, they soon repented as was evident by the continuous bickerings and rows, as
                also the consequent illegal separation that ‚Äòtook place between them and their wives. Outside my own
                family, there are scores of others who are living witnesses and examples. It is the knowledge I have of
                the step 1 am taking with my eyes open, which is the cause of my appreciating the sincerity of your
                friendship. Some sages say that man is a free agent; others say that he is others say that he is not.
                Whether man is or is not a free agent I am not in a position to say; but situated as I am now I cannot
                help saying that I am not a free agent. Defects in my wife which are dormant in our present life can
                plainly see will be roused up like a roaring lion to devour poor me; tempers and evil passions in her
                which are now varnished and glided with gold may turn a corroding iron to eat up my very soul1 know all
                these, and moreover I am not unaware that it is by far better to deal with certainties than with things
                the nature and the result of which is doubtful. If I were free to study my own as well as her future
                happiness I would certainly stop short and brave the ridicule and contempt of friends and neighbours:
                but as I said before I am not a free agent in this matter; there is something which is pressing me
                onwards; there is no retracing my steps, but I must submit to my fate. May God in his mercy help her and
                me also.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòI cannot but honour the feelings which prompt you to take such a suicidal step,‚Äô returned Mr <span
                    class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. ‚ÄòAs you are determined and cannot be persuaded, I can
                only pity you, and blame the parsons whose duty should have been to diffuse happiness, as ministers of
                God, amongst the people instead of blindly forcing them into certain misery and distress.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòThere comes <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>!‚Äô exclaimed <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; accompanied by Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>
                and escorted by the Reverend gentleman himself. Poor girl she does not know her position yet.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòWhich of the parsons?‚Äô inquired Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòMr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>,‚Äô replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>;
                then, continuing, he thus cautioned his friend. ‚ÄòNow old fellow, we must be careful what we say in the
                presence of this man. The subject which has been occupying our time is too serious, and at the same time
                delicate for us to resume it: so let us drop it, at all events for the present; for I know your temper
                and it will do no good but a great deal of harm to parties concerned.‚Äô</p>

                    ‚ÄòHis Reverence and lady are cousins of mine, and they know me too well to take umbrage at anything
                    that I choose to say to them. How are you Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>?‚Äô
                    continued he, addressing himself to the lady. ‚ÄòIt is sometime since I saw you. So you have been
                    taken in hand by my dear cousins, and are being led by them to the place where you should go; and
                    poor <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> too has ' cast behind him the world and all its
                    vanity and is ready to follow you wither- soever my godly relatives will choose to lead you. Poor
                    guileless girl! and poor <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>‚Äôs helpless.‚Äô</p>

                <p> ‚ÄòWhy do you call Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> poor, <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>?‚Äô
                    Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> asked. ‚ÄòIs it because he was elected to forsake the
                    world, the flesh and the devil, and join The people of God that he becomes poor?16 Know that he is
                    richer by far now than what he could ever have been before he enlisted under the banner of the Lord.
                    I wish I could get you also to enlist. What a bright example you too would set, and I would fain
                    ask, nay beseech, you to follow this worthy step so nobly taken by your friend.‚Äô </p>

                <p>‚ÄòOh I see that the right hand has not lost its cunning yet!‚Äô exclaimed Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> with a certain amount of sneer in his face, and in
                    the way how he expressed the words. ‚ÄòDo you know what I was telling my friend <span
                            class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> before you came? Now <span
                            class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,‚Äô continued he, addressing himself to his friend, ‚ÄòWhat
                    was it that I told you that I would do were you to continue three months a feeling telling
                    Christian? Out with it.‚Äô</p>

                <p>‚ÄòThat you would follow me, and become a class member too,‚Äô replied Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>.
                    ‚ÄòBut I am afraid you will never become one, since you make your enlistment dependent upon my
                    continuance in that body.‚Äô </p>

                <p>‚ÄòDo I see Philip in himself again?‚Äô exclaimed Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>,
                    ‚Äònow that I have heard you.‚Äô</p>

                <p>‚ÄòSay what you wished me to tell Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> which I have
                    truthfully told him, 1 sincerely hope you will put all joking aside,‚Äô interrupted Mr <span
                            class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> smiling. ‚ÄòWhat do you mean <span
                            class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>‚Äô joined in Rev <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>
                    a little warmly. ‚ÄòWould you joke in a matter of such vital importance to such a man as this? Fie! 1
                    really ‚Äî ‚Äô </p>

                <p>‚ÄòJoking!‚Äô interrupted Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. ‚ÄòWho talks about jokes
                    when a fellow is talking to your Reverend self? I never was so serious in my life. But I must
                    candidly say that if my friend here become wise during the three months, by being turned out of, or
                    leaves, the body of his own free will and accord I certainly would not be a fool to join it, my
                    honoured cousin.‚Äô </p>

                <p>Here, Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> seeing that her cousin Bonsoe was making a
                    fool of her husband, a habit which <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> had got and
                    used unmercifully when he got a chance, called upon that amiable cousin of hers to have done with
                    it. She then inquired after his wives and children at home. </p>

                <p>‚ÄòMy wives are all well,‚Äô replied Mr<span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> good humouredly,
                    ‚Äòand the young ones stunning. But why do you enquire after my wives? Are they not abominations in
                    your side, my sweet cousin?‚Äô </p>

                <p>‚ÄòHow very strange and wild you do talk to-day, cousin,‚Äô replied Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>
                    looking rather surprised. ‚ÄòYour wives abominations to me well I never. How long is it since stupid
                    notions of this sort came into your mind?‚Äô</p>

                <p>‚ÄòOnly to-day my dear cousin, only to-day,‚Äô replied he, not a little touched by Mrs <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>‚Äôs words. Then all of a sudden he assumed a serious tone,
                    laying emphasis on each word he uttered; and looking at his two relatives with an intensity of gaze
                    peculiar to persons who are not in the habit of looking at people twice in the face, continued; ‚ÄòIf
                    country marriages are abominations in the sight of God and consequently to you and your body, the
                    wives whom, as you are-aware I married according to country fashion, could not but be an
                    abomination. Am I right? <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>! Have I explained myself
                    rightly?‚Äô

                <p>‚ÄòI really cannot say,‚Äô the Revd gentleman replied. ‚ÄòBut it looks to me and to all right minded men,
                    that it is better and more respectable to have but one wife, married in the church. Is it not so
                    mentioned in Holy Writ? Why is it only to-day that you talk about your wives? Have we ever found
                    fault with either your- self or them to your knowledge?‚Äô ‚ÄòYou have certainly never found fault with
                    me and with them, as you say, to my knowledge,‚Äô replied <span
                            class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> hotly; ‚Äòand never will if I can help myself.
                    But‚Äô, continued he rather complacently, ‚Äòlook at our mutual friend <span class="personal-name">Qauibu</span>
                    and his amiable wife; is it because you find fault with them or that they have lived unhappily
                    together, or that they were not looked upon by European gentlemen as well as native and even by men
                    of ‚Äúyour cloth‚Äù as respectable in their native or country married state, that they are now made to
                    exchange sub- stance - real happiness - for a shadow?‚Äô. </p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>In the last chapter we mentioned that <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> called over to see Mr &
                Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> and also mentioned somewhere that she had been of late
                in the habit of going there frequently. Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, as has been
                intimated before, was a - Wesleyan minister, a zealous man of the old school. He was one of the trained
                men Revd. Mr <span class="personal-name-20">Fitzmaurice </span>brought up in the ministry. If he was
                deficient in education and could barely read and write and with difficulty speak the English language,
                he was nevertheless a very good man, and able speaker, was successful in gaining souls in his
                ministrations, and moreover for a native he was| liberal in his religious tenets. As he made no
                ostentatious displays of religion in conversation, as some of his cloth did; and knew when and how to
                introduce religious matter in conversation and when to talk about other subjects, Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> found great delight in the Rev. gentleman‚Äôs company, and
                from mere acquaintance they became very good friends. It was his habit to call upon Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> frequently and on these occasions religion formed the
                principle topic of conversation, although other subjects were taken in hand too. As were the men so also
                became the women, and Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, and Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> became also intimate.</p>

            <p>One evening as the Revd. gentleman and his spouse were chatting together in their house, Mr <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and several friends, among whom were some Europeans, passed by.
                These jovial friends had been enjoying themselves during the day, going from house to house, and at the
                time they passed the minister‚Äôs house they were each and all, ‚Äòthree sheets in the wind.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòWhat a pity,‚Äô cried Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> to her husband, ‚ÄòMr <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> should be under such corrupting influences home he is always
                quiet, and busy at his work. If his friends would leave him alone, you as a minister could never find a
                better man to associate with. It is not becoming, as a minister and preacher of the gospel, to have such
                a worldly man as a friend. Can you not get him to join the society? Joining the Society‚Äô means, with the
                Christians of the Wesleyan body, to become a class member. ‚ÄòMy dear Mary,‚Äô replied Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, assuming a dignified and clerical air peculiar to him,
                ‚Äòdo you think I have been so long on intimate terms with Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>
                without exercising the sacred prerogative which God, in his grace, has I granted me to use, in order to
                recover miserable souls subjected to Satan and under his thraldom? Many a day have I had a talk with him
                on the subject of his soul's salvation, and of the necessity of his enlisting as a class member, which
                course alone, and no other way, could entitle him to be considered a good man, and a reformed christian.
                But the man has a peculiar way of repelling me whenever I speak to him about class meetings. He has such
                an aversion to the thing, so much so that I am afraid he will go to hell like several of his clique, if
                the way to heaven is only through being a class member. I have done all I can to him, and to no purpose.
            </p>

            <p>'Have you then decided,' rejoined Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, 'to leave the poor
                man with Satan? It would be a pity were you to lose heart in the glorious and praise- worthy step you
                have taken to reclaim him. Persevere John, for I know that if you succeed with him his wife will also
                follow. </p>

            <p>It is utterly impossible!' cried Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> despairingly; 'but I can
                see a way of surmounting this difficulty. Through dear Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>
                we will doubtless succeed; so as early as you can manage to have time, pay her a visit to persuade her
                to come with you. Between the two of us we will, I am sure, be able to successfully lay siege to his
                religious prejudices through her and in the course of time convert him and his lady. </p>

            <p>Obedient to her lord's command Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> the next day repaired to
                Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>'s house, and seeing Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>
                disengaged had some chat with her and when she was leaving managed to get her to accompany her. Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> seeing them quietly went to his bedroom unperceived by
                the ladies and there waited till he found an opportune time to come arrayed in such abillment as became
                his position when he wanted to covert souls</p>

                <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> who judging by the way for him. absence of her husband

                o'clock this morning. Between 8 and 9 o'clock this morning before he had scarcely rested Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> and his brother Bonsoe Coomah called over to take 'a
                refresher,' as they called it, with him; and they continued at it for some time before they left. <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had just finished breakfast and as the steamer was expected
                he was busy writing his business letters when all the friends that were invited to Mr <span

                with him, of course drinking. There was no staying at home for him after that and they all went out
                together. He came home late in the night ‚Äúscrewed‚Äù21 and it is no wonder that you did not see him when
                you came in. He went to bed immediately after breakfast I must not stay out long as he may probably want

                should Keep such company ana scatter away his precious time. Why don‚Äôt you speak to him about it. Mr
                <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> says that he has several times pointed out to him the
                necessity of his joining the society, which is the only source of happiness but he has failed and has
                given up any further attempt.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòI can assure you dear Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>‚Äô replied she ‚Äòthat I regret
                exceedingly the life my husband is now leading. In ‚Äî‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòYour husband! ‚Äô interrupted the minister‚Äôs wife most indignantly. ‚ÄòDid I not tell you a short time ago
                that he is not your husband? Have I not told you often. . and my husband the same, that native marriages
                are not marriages in a legal I sense? If custom has established them, does not common sense teach us to
                Know the utter absurdity of them? Marriage where the contracting parties, the man as well as the woman,
                have power to dissolve it at will is in the estimation of the church no marriage at all. Do you not know
                that Mr <span class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> can send you away tomorrow it he likes, or you can go
                away from him? I know that there is the most intense love subsisting between you; why does he not take
                you to church at once? The very fact of his not having done so, altho‚Äô you have lived together more than
                8 years, shows some intention on his part to send you adrift as soon as he finds one who would suit him
                better. I would advise you therefore as a friend and as one who has got your interests at hear to make a
                stand and show him by your future conduct that he must decide between you and any one he may chance to
                choose. He would not be a member, and you are not; if you were, God should Grant you such grace and
                strength that in the course of time this design could be accomplished. You should ‚Äî‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòEnough,‚Äô cried Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> interrupting her, and bewildered. She
                was grieved and at the same time annoyed, partly with herself and partly with her companion, for taking
                such liberties with, and talking in such a high tone to her and she to be quiet. Nobody else but a
                minister‚Äôs wife could presume to talk to her in this manner with impunity. ‚ÄòEnough‚Äô, she cried; I did
                not think that you were going to take me over to your house to insult me, for insult I take your words
                to be; and but for the extreme respect I have for you this would be the last time you, ever see me in
                your house. For several years 1 have lived with this man and I never experienced an unkind word, any
                ill-treatment or the least sign of a wish to break off the connection between us and above all I have
                never seen any difference between his conduct towards me, either private or public and other men‚Äôs
                conduct towards their wives althogh married according to the church. I am satisfied with him living as
                we are, and I am sure he will never think of sending me away so long as 1 conduct myself in the same way
                as I have hitherto done towards him. I do not, however, wish it to be understood that I am satisfied
                with my husband‚Äôs late unseemly conduct; but that is a fault not to be attributed to the nature of our
                marriage; and I sincerely wish I could find some means of bringing about some reformation in him.‚Äô </p>

            <p>For some minutes there was a lull in their conversation, after this sudden exhibition of spirit which had
                hitherto lain dormant in Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>; Mrs <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> was too greatly taken aback at the manner in which Miss
                <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> took her up to sustain her part of the conversation. True
                they had known each other for some time but she never for a moment thought that Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> would presume to talk like that to her on any occasion.
            </p>
            <p>Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> did not lose a word of what passed between the two
                ladies, and at this stage, he thought it was high time to join them. He accosted Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> in a most complacent manner; in which spirit she also
                returned the compliment. Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> thought when he joined the
                ladies that there was no chance for him to succeed in his disinterested work of converting Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, through whom he thought he could get at Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu </span> upon whose conversion he had principally set his heart.
