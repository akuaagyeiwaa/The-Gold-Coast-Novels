                <div class="author-info">
                    <h3>Author Biography</h3>
                    <p>The author of Marita or the Folly of Love employed the pseudonym ‚ÄúA Native‚Äù to signal that the work was authored by an indigenous inhabitant of the Gold Coast colony. This pseudonymous authorship is widely interpreted as a strategic decision, given the critical stance the novel adopts toward colonial governance and societal norms. Scholarly opinion remains divided regarding the true identity of the author. While several researchers‚Äîincluding Jenkins (1985), Baku (1987), and Gocking (1999)‚Äîattribute the work to J. E. Casely Hayford, others have challenged this attribution. Yitah and Dako, for example, assert that "A. Native was an erudite scholar" (362) and, based on a close analysis of the text‚Äôs language, imagery, and stylistic features, contend that James Hutton Brew, rather than Casely Hayford, authored the novel (Yitah and Dako 362)</p>.


                  <p>The intellectual elite of the Gold Coast, driven by a desire for self-representation and public discourse, frequently engaged in literary and political writing across various periodicals. However, due to the subversive or anti-colonial tone of many of these writings, they were often excluded from mainstream colonial publications such as The Gold Coast Times and The Gold Coast Press. In response, James Hutton Brew established The Western Echo, a private newspaper based in Abura Dunkwa, which later became known as The Gold Coast Echo. This publication provided a vital platform for the Gold Coast intelligentsia to circulate their ideas through essays, fictional narratives, and serialized novels. Notably, Marita or the Folly of Love was serialized in this newspaper across approximately forty installments between 1885 and 1888.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>‚ÄòSo my dear friend, yon have gone and done it; I am surprised and astonished at you, I certainly gave you
                more credit for a good share of common sense, and sufficient knowledge of the world. Is it possible, and
                can it be true that it was yours the banns, that was published in the chapel yesterday?‚Äô This was
                uttered by a man of about forty five years, strong but slenderly built, and of middle stature;
                complexion sallow red, his eyes were keen but yet seldom look you twice in the face, and his features
                regular. His manners were grave, but a more jovial and sincere friend never lived. In his youth he had
                the advantage of the best English education; besides being a good Latin, Greek and Hebrew scholar. <span
                        class="personal-name">Bonsoe Penin</span>, the name of this gentleman, was not a bachelor, yet
                he was married, he had several wives; two he had living with him in his own house; the rest lived in
                their own houses, and it is strange to say that he lived happily with them all.</p>


            <p>Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, the hero of this tale, was a man who had just entered his
                fortieth year short and slenderly built, healthy and strong. His features were not different from any of
                his countrymen‚Äôs - real type of a negro. He also had the advantage of English education, moved in the
                highest society, both European and native, and at the time that this tale was commenced he was filling a
                post -which was worth to him several hundred pounds sterling a year.</p>

            <p>These two gentlemen were fast friends, so strong was their friendship that not a day passed but what you
                would see them together. No wonder therefore that Mr <span class="personal-name">Bonsoe Penin</span>
                used such familiar terms to his friend <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòGently, <span class="personal-name">Bonsoe Penin</span>,‚Äô replied <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, ‚ÄòNot -so fast. Take a seat and cool yourself with a glass of
                Moselle and soda before you attempt to talk, as you are burning with heat. It is thus that I punish you
                for your hard words. After you have rested we will find time to talk about the matter and any amount of
                nonsense you like.‚Äô </p>

            <p> ‚ÄòBy ‚Äî ! <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> you are really provoking! I swear that 1 will not sit
                down, nor allow myself to be insulted by your offer of drink until you have satisfied me. Was the banns
                published yours and Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>‚Äôs?‚Äô replied <span
                        class="personal-name-3"><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span></span> persistently.
            </p>

            <p> ‚ÄòYes, <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>, are you satisfied now? or rather, are you in
                such a state as would admit of your taking a ‚Äúshot‚Äù now before talking.‚Äô </p>

            <p><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> here took a seat on the other side of the table at
                which he met his friend sitting and writing his books. Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>
                called for a bottle of Moselle and two of soda and glasses. The boy took off the wines, placed the
                bottles on the tables and then retired leaving the two friends to enjoy themselves. ‚ÄòHow clumsy you are
                today <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>‚Äô, exclaimed <span
                        class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> getting up suddenly. ‚ÄòBy Jove! you have wet me all
                over. On my clean shirt and collar! and I am due the court in twenty minutes time, and His Honour the
                Chief Justice is so provokingly punctual! Where the d‚Äî am I going to get a change of shirt? And the
                court is fully 15 minutes ride from here. I wish I never allowed myself to be tempted by this accursed
                drink. What must I do, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>?‚Äô </p>

            <p>I will lend you a shirt, old fellow and a dozen collars if you like,‚Äô replied <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> laughing. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòPooh, man your shirt wont fit me, it will choke me. I will none of your babyish shirts, especially in
                court and to-day too when I have to defend a poor murderer and have to do all I can to save the poor
                man‚Äôs innocent neck from coming into close proximity with the hangman‚Äôs noose.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòNo, no, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, I would rather play truant to-day from Court and
                endure his Honour‚Äôs reprimand tomorrow than lose my client‚Äôs cause, which I would certainly do were I to
                go to Court to-day with your shirt on.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòBoy! boy!‚Äô called Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> to his servant; ‚Äòbring another bottle of
                Moselle. I must say <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>, if your ‚Äúlearned self,‚Äù instead
                of apparel, had shown such a great aptitude for drinking to-day I would certainly be glad. See there is
                not a drop of wine left in the bottle and we are still dry. You will open the second bottle, and after
                we have had our first shot you will indite a letter to His Honour to postpone the hearing of your case
                until tomorrow; after which we will have time to talk freely and uninterruptedly.‚Äô </p>

            <p><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> here upon indited a letter to His Honour assigning
                other reasons than that which was the true cause of his inability to attend the Court; and after
                despatching it by his own boy, sat down minus coat as contented as if no mishap had taken place and the
                two friends commenced talking seriously together</p>.

                            <p>We must now leave these two gentlemen, and introduce the heroine of this tale to the reader. Miss <span
                    class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, at the time that this tale commenced was a woman of about
                four and twenty years old; in stature she was short, but proportionably well built; she was neither
                stout nor thin, although she had a tendency towards stoutness. Her features were not very regular but
                extremely pleasing; her gait or steps were faultless, and she has a way of carrying herself among her
                own class ‚Äî the uneducated women ‚Äî that she is everywhere considered to be equal if not superior to any
                of her companions. It is only in company of educated ladies that she exhibits a consciousness of
                inferiority. Coupled with these natural advantages she has a strong and well regulated mind which wanted
                only education to have made her perfect. In fact she was a woman gifted by nature to adorn any (XP
                society if she had been cultured. Was it to be wondered at that Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> became fascinated by her even in spite of her want of
                education, and the occasional burst of temper which she exhibited. Love is blind, and in the case of Mr
                <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> as well as Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>‚Äôs,
                <span class="personal-name-cupid"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid"
                                                     target="_blank">Cupid</a></span> never played a severer trick upon
                two fools. </p>

            <p>Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> had
                lived as man and wife for more than eight years, enjoying all the, blessings of married life. Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> showed the same amount of respect for his lady as he would
                have shown had their marriage been solemnized in the Church. He stuck to her alone and would on no
                account take or keep any other woman. Every lady respected her as if a minister had joined them together
                in holy wedlock. Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> on her part honoured and above all
                obeyed Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> in every thing and at all times. She felt great
                interest in her good man‚Äôs affairs, which she in every way considered as her own. In fact, no two
                persons that have been united together by the church could have lived more happily together than those
                two who were only married by country marriage,10 a marriage looked down upon as debasing and degrading.
            </p>

            <p> I may add that although Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and his wife attended chapel and
                were <span class="personal-name-christians"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians"
                                                               target="_blank">Christians</a></span>, nominally, since
                they were not class members," yet the gentleman through reasons of his own would never be induced to
                attend class meetings. As for the lady she never knew what it was, until Mrs <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> the minister's wife and her husband who was a friend of
                Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> thought it a duty incumbent upon them to endeavour to
                convert her. They accordingly got her to enter her name in the class list, and in course of time was
                baptized and duly became a member of the <span class="place-name-wesleyan"><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesleyan_theology" target="_blank">Wesleyan</a></span> body;
                Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> seeing no fault in the step having given his consent
                thereto previously. From that day things began to wear a different aspect; Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> visibly changed. What delighted her before became sin in
                her eyes. Those innocent and harmless pleasures that used to amuse her were considered by her as sinful;
                she became moody, discontented and restless. She would, for hours, go to the minister‚Äôs house and come
                home looking as if something was troubling her mind. To Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>‚Äôs
                inquiries as to her change of conduct and behaviour, she would reply ‚Äònothing.‚Äô In the meantime Rev: Mr
                <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> became assiduous in pressing Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> to become a class member, as [Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> had been, and that it only wanted that to make <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> and himself happy in their marriage life. Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> could not well see through that, for had he not lived with
                his wife more than eight years happily and in the most agreeable manner? From that day he saw and deeply
                felt that the heart of his lady as well as her love and affections had been taken away from him, and by
                a certain mistaken notion of christian religion. Henceforward he must make up his mind to lead a
                miserable life with her he loved, unless he turned her away at once or became a class member himself.
                Things were in this state when a European minister arrived who took charge of the station and Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> became his assistant. Rev Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-19">Powers</span> and Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> became
                friends, and in a short time their friendship developed into intimacy. Religion formed principally the
                subject of their conversation; and after a time Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> was induced
                to promise and ultimately become a class member, having for leader his friend Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>. </p>

            <p>If his obstinacy to be a class member was the cause of the change of con- duct in Miss <span
                    class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had cause to
                rejoice when he enrolled his name as a member of the Wesleyan Society; for the same spirit of
                contentment, love and happiness that ruled in their domestic hearth before Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> became a member returned and they lived happily together
                again. But the two ministers had not finished with them yet. <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>
                must give to his wife a ring through a minister, before God and in the open chapel; in fine they must
                enter into the ‚ÄòHoly state of matrimony‚Äô before they could be admitted as full members of the society.
                In for a penny, in for a pound. The lady was willing, her people were willing; <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had to consult nobody, and there was ‚Äòno just cause or
                impediment‚Äô why he also should not be willing; for had he not lived for several years happily together
                with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>? Before God, Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> conscientiously considered Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> legally his wife although no minister had married them. He
                had not the least doubt that God, the searcher of hearts considered them as man and wife; and if it only
                wanted the mere putting on of a ring on the part of the woman to make their marriage legal in the eyes
                of men, well, he must conform to it: and the announcement of their banns was accordingly published in
                the Sunday previous to the day Bonsoe Pennin called on his friend Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> in the great trepidation and astonishment mentioned at the
                opening of this chapter. </p>

                of his friend. I seldom see her lately; she used to call very often at my house to see her friends; but
                it seems to me that she avoids the place now. What can be the matter, <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>?‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòI really do not know;‚Äô replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu:</span> ‚Äòunless because she is now a
                class member, and the duty attached to her spiritual concerns gives hei no time to call. Mrs D your wife
                was here the day before yesterday, and remained several hours with her chatting together.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòDo you really mean,‚Äô asked <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> in astonishment, ‚Äòthat Miss
                <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> is now a class member? and who is her leader?‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòI mean not only to tell you that <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> is a member,‚Äô returned

            <p>This news, true as it was, did not a little startle Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>.
                For some minutes he could not open his mouth, but sat down in the utmost astonishment, looking at his
                friend. At last ne said: </p>

            <p>‚ÄòWords fail me to express my sentiments; allow me to congratulate you. I must candidly say, however, that

            <p> Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> was, in the utmost degree, 'perplexed; he saw that his
                darling structure was tottering; the axe which Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>
                wielded so well was doing all possible mischief to his enchanted edifice, and unless he made some
                desperate stand he would find his sweet hopes of unalloyed happiness in the new marriage scattered to

                afterwards embraced, compelled them to take unto themselves new wives and marry them according to the
                Church. In their hearts, they soon repented as was evident by the continuous bickerings and rows, as
                also the consequent illegal separation that ‚Äòtook place between them and their wives. Outside my own
                family, there are scores of others who are living witnesses and examples. It is the knowledge I have of
                the step 1 am taking with my eyes open, which is the cause of my appreciating the sincerity of your
                friendship. Some sages say that man is a free agent; others say that he is others say that he is not.
                Whether man is or is not a free agent I am not in a position to say; but situated as I am now I cannot
                help saying that I am not a free agent. Defects in my wife which are dormant in our present life can
                plainly see will be roused up like a roaring lion to devour poor me; tempers and evil passions in her
                which are now varnished and glided with gold may turn a corroding iron to eat up my very soul1 know all
                these, and moreover I am not unaware that it is by far better to deal with certainties than with things
                the nature and the result of which is doubtful. If I were free to study my own as well as her future
                happiness I would certainly stop short and brave the ridicule and contempt of friends and neighbours:
                but as I said before I am not a free agent in this matter; there is something which is pressing me
                onwards; there is no retracing my steps, but I must submit to my fate. May God in his mercy help her and
                me also.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòI cannot but honour the feelings which prompt you to take such a suicidal step,‚Äô returned Mr <span
                    class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. ‚ÄòAs you are determined and cannot be persuaded, I can
                only pity you, and blame the parsons whose duty should have been to diffuse happiness, as ministers of
                God, amongst the people instead of blindly forcing them into certain misery and distress.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòThere comes <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>!‚Äô exclaimed <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; accompanied by Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>
                and escorted by the Reverend gentleman himself. Poor girl she does not know her position yet.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòWhich of the parsons?‚Äô inquired Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòMr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>,‚Äô replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>;
                then, continuing, he thus cautioned his friend. ‚ÄòNow old fellow, we must be careful what we say in the
                presence of this man. The subject which has been occupying our time is too serious, and at the same time
                delicate for us to resume it: so let us drop it, at all events for the present; for I know your temper
                and it will do no good but a great deal of harm to parties concerned.‚Äô</p>

                    ‚ÄòHis Reverence and lady are cousins of mine, and they know me too well to take umbrage at anything
                    that I choose to say to them. How are you Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>?‚Äô
                    continued he, addressing himself to the lady. ‚ÄòIt is sometime since I saw you. So you have been
                    taken in hand by my dear cousins, and are being led by them to the place where you should go; and
                    poor <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> too has ' cast behind him the world and all its
                    vanity and is ready to follow you wither- soever my godly relatives will choose to lead you. Poor
                    guileless girl! and poor <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>‚Äôs helpless.‚Äô</p>

                <p> ‚ÄòWhy do you call Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> poor, <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>?‚Äô
                    Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> asked. ‚ÄòIs it because he was elected to forsake the
                    world, the flesh and the devil, and join The people of God that he becomes poor?16 Know that he is
                    richer by far now than what he could ever have been before he enlisted under the banner of the Lord.
                    I wish I could get you also to enlist. What a bright example you too would set, and I would fain
                    ask, nay beseech, you to follow this worthy step so nobly taken by your friend.‚Äô </p>

                <p>‚ÄòOh I see that the right hand has not lost its cunning yet!‚Äô exclaimed Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> with a certain amount of sneer in his face, and in
                    the way how he expressed the words. ‚ÄòDo you know what I was telling my friend <span
                            class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> before you came? Now <span
                            class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,‚Äô continued he, addressing himself to his friend, ‚ÄòWhat
                    was it that I told you that I would do were you to continue three months a feeling telling
                    Christian? Out with it.‚Äô</p>

                <p>‚ÄòThat you would follow me, and become a class member too,‚Äô replied Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>.
                    ‚ÄòBut I am afraid you will never become one, since you make your enlistment dependent upon my
                    continuance in that body.‚Äô </p>

                <p>‚ÄòDo I see Philip in himself again?‚Äô exclaimed Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>,
                    ‚Äònow that I have heard you.‚Äô</p>

                <p>‚ÄòSay what you wished me to tell Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> which I have
                    truthfully told him, 1 sincerely hope you will put all joking aside,‚Äô interrupted Mr <span
                            class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> smiling. ‚ÄòWhat do you mean <span
                            class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>‚Äô joined in Rev <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>
                    a little warmly. ‚ÄòWould you joke in a matter of such vital importance to such a man as this? Fie! 1
                    really ‚Äî ‚Äô </p>

                <p>‚ÄòJoking!‚Äô interrupted Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. ‚ÄòWho talks about jokes
                    when a fellow is talking to your Reverend self? I never was so serious in my life. But I must
                    candidly say that if my friend here become wise during the three months, by being turned out of, or
                    leaves, the body of his own free will and accord I certainly would not be a fool to join it, my
                    honoured cousin.‚Äô </p>

                <p>Here, Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> seeing that her cousin Bonsoe was making a
                    fool of her husband, a habit which <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> had got and
                    used unmercifully when he got a chance, called upon that amiable cousin of hers to have done with
                    it. She then inquired after his wives and children at home. </p>

                <p>‚ÄòMy wives are all well,‚Äô replied Mr<span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> good humouredly,
                    ‚Äòand the young ones stunning. But why do you enquire after my wives? Are they not abominations in
                    your side, my sweet cousin?‚Äô </p>

                <p>‚ÄòHow very strange and wild you do talk to-day, cousin,‚Äô replied Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>
                    looking rather surprised. ‚ÄòYour wives abominations to me well I never. How long is it since stupid
                    notions of this sort came into your mind?‚Äô</p>

                <p>‚ÄòOnly to-day my dear cousin, only to-day,‚Äô replied he, not a little touched by Mrs <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>‚Äôs words. Then all of a sudden he assumed a serious tone,
                    laying emphasis on each word he uttered; and looking at his two relatives with an intensity of gaze
                    peculiar to persons who are not in the habit of looking at people twice in the face, continued; ‚ÄòIf
                    country marriages are abominations in the sight of God and consequently to you and your body, the
                    wives whom, as you are-aware I married according to country fashion, could not but be an
                    abomination. Am I right? <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>! Have I explained myself
                    rightly?‚Äô

                <p>‚ÄòI really cannot say,‚Äô the Revd gentleman replied. ‚ÄòBut it looks to me and to all right minded men,
                    that it is better and more respectable to have but one wife, married in the church. Is it not so
                    mentioned in Holy Writ? Why is it only to-day that you talk about your wives? Have we ever found
                    fault with either your- self or them to your knowledge?‚Äô ‚ÄòYou have certainly never found fault with
                    me and with them, as you say, to my knowledge,‚Äô replied <span
                            class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> hotly; ‚Äòand never will if I can help myself.
                    But‚Äô, continued he rather complacently, ‚Äòlook at our mutual friend <span class="personal-name">Qauibu</span>
                    and his amiable wife; is it because you find fault with them or that they have lived unhappily
                    together, or that they were not looked upon by European gentlemen as well as native and even by men
                    of ‚Äúyour cloth‚Äù as respectable in their native or country married state, that they are now made to
                    exchange sub- stance - real happiness - for a shadow?‚Äô. </p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>In the last chapter we mentioned that <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> called over to see Mr &
                Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> and also mentioned somewhere that she had been of late
                in the habit of going there frequently. Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, as has been
                intimated before, was a - Wesleyan minister, a zealous man of the old school. He was one of the trained
                men Revd. Mr <span class="personal-name-20">Fitzmaurice </span>brought up in the ministry. If he was
                deficient in education and could barely read and write and with difficulty speak the English language,
                he was nevertheless a very good man, and able speaker, was successful in gaining souls in his
                ministrations, and moreover for a native he was| liberal in his religious tenets. As he made no
                ostentatious displays of religion in conversation, as some of his cloth did; and knew when and how to
                introduce religious matter in conversation and when to talk about other subjects, Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> found great delight in the Rev. gentleman‚Äôs company, and
                from mere acquaintance they became very good friends. It was his habit to call upon Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> frequently and on these occasions religion formed the
                principle topic of conversation, although other subjects were taken in hand too. As were the men so also
                became the women, and Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, and Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> became also intimate.</p>

            <p>One evening as the Revd. gentleman and his spouse were chatting together in their house, Mr <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and several friends, among whom were some Europeans, passed by.
                These jovial friends had been enjoying themselves during the day, going from house to house, and at the
                time they passed the minister‚Äôs house they were each and all, ‚Äòthree sheets in the wind.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòWhat a pity,‚Äô cried Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> to her husband, ‚ÄòMr <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> should be under such corrupting influences home he is always
                quiet, and busy at his work. If his friends would leave him alone, you as a minister could never find a
                better man to associate with. It is not becoming, as a minister and preacher of the gospel, to have such
                a worldly man as a friend. Can you not get him to join the society? Joining the Society‚Äô means, with the
                Christians of the Wesleyan body, to become a class member. ‚ÄòMy dear Mary,‚Äô replied Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, assuming a dignified and clerical air peculiar to him,
                ‚Äòdo you think I have been so long on intimate terms with Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>
                without exercising the sacred prerogative which God, in his grace, has I granted me to use, in order to
                recover miserable souls subjected to Satan and under his thraldom? Many a day have I had a talk with him
                on the subject of his soul's salvation, and of the necessity of his enlisting as a class member, which
                course alone, and no other way, could entitle him to be considered a good man, and a reformed christian.
                But the man has a peculiar way of repelling me whenever I speak to him about class meetings. He has such
                an aversion to the thing, so much so that I am afraid he will go to hell like several of his clique, if
                the way to heaven is only through being a class member. I have done all I can to him, and to no purpose.
            </p>

            <p>'Have you then decided,' rejoined Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, 'to leave the poor
                man with Satan? It would be a pity were you to lose heart in the glorious and praise- worthy step you
                have taken to reclaim him. Persevere John, for I know that if you succeed with him his wife will also
                follow. </p>

            <p>It is utterly impossible!' cried Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> despairingly; 'but I can
                see a way of surmounting this difficulty. Through dear Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>
                we will doubtless succeed; so as early as you can manage to have time, pay her a visit to persuade her
                to come with you. Between the two of us we will, I am sure, be able to successfully lay siege to his
                religious prejudices through her and in the course of time convert him and his lady. </p>

            <p>Obedient to her lord's command Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> the next day repaired to
                Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>'s house, and seeing Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>
                disengaged had some chat with her and when she was leaving managed to get her to accompany her. Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> seeing them quietly went to his bedroom unperceived by
                the ladies and there waited till he found an opportune time to come arrayed in such abillment as became
                his position when he wanted to covert souls</p>

                <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> who judging by the way for him. absence of her husband

                o'clock this morning. Between 8 and 9 o'clock this morning before he had scarcely rested Mr <span
                        class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> and his brother Bonsoe Coomah called over to take 'a
                refresher,' as they called it, with him; and they continued at it for some time before they left. <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had just finished breakfast and as the steamer was expected
                he was busy writing his business letters when all the friends that were invited to Mr <span

                with him, of course drinking. There was no staying at home for him after that and they all went out
                together. He came home late in the night ‚Äúscrewed‚Äù21 and it is no wonder that you did not see him when
                you came in. He went to bed immediately after breakfast I must not stay out long as he may probably want

                should Keep such company ana scatter away his precious time. Why don‚Äôt you speak to him about it. Mr
                <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> says that he has several times pointed out to him the
                necessity of his joining the society, which is the only source of happiness but he has failed and has
                given up any further attempt.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòI can assure you dear Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>‚Äô replied she ‚Äòthat I regret
                exceedingly the life my husband is now leading. In ‚Äî‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòYour husband! ‚Äô interrupted the minister‚Äôs wife most indignantly. ‚ÄòDid I not tell you a short time ago
                that he is not your husband? Have I not told you often. . and my husband the same, that native marriages
                are not marriages in a legal I sense? If custom has established them, does not common sense teach us to
                Know the utter absurdity of them? Marriage where the contracting parties, the man as well as the woman,
                have power to dissolve it at will is in the estimation of the church no marriage at all. Do you not know
                that Mr <span class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> can send you away tomorrow it he likes, or you can go
                away from him? I know that there is the most intense love subsisting between you; why does he not take
                you to church at once? The very fact of his not having done so, altho‚Äô you have lived together more than
                8 years, shows some intention on his part to send you adrift as soon as he finds one who would suit him
                better. I would advise you therefore as a friend and as one who has got your interests at hear to make a
                stand and show him by your future conduct that he must decide between you and any one he may chance to
                choose. He would not be a member, and you are not; if you were, God should Grant you such grace and
                strength that in the course of time this design could be accomplished. You should ‚Äî‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòEnough,‚Äô cried Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> interrupting her, and bewildered. She
                was grieved and at the same time annoyed, partly with herself and partly with her companion, for taking
                such liberties with, and talking in such a high tone to her and she to be quiet. Nobody else but a
                minister‚Äôs wife could presume to talk to her in this manner with impunity. ‚ÄòEnough‚Äô, she cried; I did
                not think that you were going to take me over to your house to insult me, for insult I take your words
                to be; and but for the extreme respect I have for you this would be the last time you, ever see me in
                your house. For several years 1 have lived with this man and I never experienced an unkind word, any
                ill-treatment or the least sign of a wish to break off the connection between us and above all I have
                never seen any difference between his conduct towards me, either private or public and other men‚Äôs
                conduct towards their wives althogh married according to the church. I am satisfied with him living as
                we are, and I am sure he will never think of sending me away so long as 1 conduct myself in the same way
                as I have hitherto done towards him. I do not, however, wish it to be understood that I am satisfied
                with my husband‚Äôs late unseemly conduct; but that is a fault not to be attributed to the nature of our
                marriage; and I sincerely wish I could find some means of bringing about some reformation in him.‚Äô </p>

            <p>For some minutes there was a lull in their conversation, after this sudden exhibition of spirit which had
                hitherto lain dormant in Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>; Mrs <span
                        class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> was too greatly taken aback at the manner in which Miss
                <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> took her up to sustain her part of the conversation. True
                they had known each other for some time but she never for a moment thought that Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> would presume to talk like that to her on any occasion.
            </p>
            <p>Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> did not lose a word of what passed between the two
                ladies, and at this stage, he thought it was high time to join them. He accosted Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> in a most complacent manner; in which spirit she also
                returned the compliment. Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> thought when he joined the
                ladies that there was no chance for him to succeed in his disinterested work of converting Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, through whom he thought he could get at Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu </span> upon whose conversion he had principally set his heart.

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>‚ÄòI have been rather busy in my study,‚Äô began he when he joined them, up a sermon for Sunday, a most
                insinuating air, ‚ÄòI ‚Äògetting By the bye,‚Äô continued he, at the same time assuming am glad to see that
                you go to chapel occasionally, and to observe that you are a good and attentive listener. I have
                observed you often whilst preaching, and it did my heart good to see you so piously bent. May I ask,
                were you in the habit of going to chapel before you came to this place? I should like very much to know
                that.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòVery seldom Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>,‚Äô she replied. I had no wish.‚Äô ‚ÄòThat augurs
                well since now your attendance here is more frequent. Do you find the sermons interesting?‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòYes, some of them, not all,‚Äô she replied, smiling. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòThat‚Äôs right; but do you find any difference between the speeches (sermons) made in chapel and the
                speeches made at any other place? You under- stand what I mean of course?‚Äô </p>

            <p> ‚ÄòYes the difference is vast. I always fee1 glad and happy when I hear the word of God preached, and when
                it is talked about. There is something in it that I am unable to express.‚Äô

            <p>‚ÄòWould you not join the people of God then, when such are your feelings when you hear his word preached?‚Äô
                demanded Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, his countenance radiant with smiles. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòCertainly I would; but who do you mean are the people of God? are not all the people that go to chapel
                God‚Äôs people?‚Äô</p>

            <p> ‚ÄòCertainly not. The people of God are those who finding that they are sinners, enter their names as
                members of the society, and who regularly attend class meetings. Would you not wish to become a class
                member, and be one of God‚Äôs people?‚Äô </p>

            <p>I should like it very much ‚Äî‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòBut supposing Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,‚Äô interrupted the Reverend gentleman
                intentionally, ‚Äòwere to tell you not to, what would you do? Would you obey him rather than keeping the
                promise you have just given me?‚Äô ‚ÄòMy husband never denies my anything which he considers good for me;
                and in this one I am sure he will allow me.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòYou do very well to have such confidence in your husband - in Mr <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; but supposing he prevents you?‚Äô</p>

            <p>Do not press the point Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>,‚Äô replied Miss <span
                    class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> somewhat curtly; T I know that he will allow me. It is true
                that he does not wish to be one himself, but I never heard him speak ill against it.‚Äô </p>

            <p>What he 'When may I hear from you Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>?' Mr <span
                    class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> asked, not feeling alto- so her husband and have given such a
                promise from which she could not turn and by which he (could hold her. </p>

            <p>'As soon as I speak to my husband about it,' she replied. 'Now I must go home,' added she, getting up, 'I
                have stayed longer than I thought, and I may be wanted now.' </p>

            <p>Stay one moment, dear Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>,' besought the Rev gentleman,
                'only one moment! It appears to me that there is some coldness between you and my wife which must be
                made right before you leave. Will you shake hands together and be cordial friends again. That's right.
                We will now kneel down and ask divine blessing upon our humble endeavours to gain more sheep and bring
                them into his fold.'</p>

            <p>Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> left as soon as the prayer was over, leaving Mr <span
                    class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> and his wife to deliberate on the probable result of their
                proceedings. </p>

            <p>'You very nearly spoilt the game my dear,' said Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>. 'It was
                very fortunate that I was listening, and therefore was able to join in at the right moment or we don't
                know what the result would have been. You women could never be tacticians, What a pity it would have
                been had we lost her, and, through her Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>.' </p>

            <p>'It would have been a pity indeed,' replied his better half, 'but whoever thought that under a calm,
                quiet and placid exterior as she generally manifested, there lurked a spirit - a temper like that. I was
                really taken aback; and I am afraid, had you not dropped in at the right moment, there would have been a
                row, as I certainly could not bear such an insult from a person who is merely kept by a man. </p>

            <p>I am very glad that I dropped in then,' replied Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>
                seriously, 'for you would have got the worse of the conflict of words which you women generally delight
                in. Have you been so long intimate with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, and are
                ignorant of her natural disposition? Don't talk nonsense my dear, but be thankful that I saved you and
                the great cause likewise.</p>

            <p>Who talks of nonsense but you Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>?' asked his spouse, her
                temper getting up. 'You men usually take the part of other women against your own wives, ministers not
                excepted.' </p>

            <p>'And you ladies generally take the part of other men against your own husbands, ministers' wives not
                excepted,' returned Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>. 'Would you despise your hand
                because you have inadvertently plunged it into something loathsome? Would you not rather wash it clean
                in lavender water and bring it to its former state? Well, is it because one woman, who is as much a
                creature of God as you are, happened not to be married according to Church rites that she is to be
                despised by other women because they are so married? Should we not rather persuade her to enter into
                Church marriage and thereby save her soul? If you don't despise your hand, because it has touched an
                unclean thing, why should you despise a woman because she happened to live in a state of concubinage? Is
                that a spirit of charity? Don‚Äôt let me hear any more of such unchristian expressions from you again; and
                I hope you will assist me in my endeavours to convert these two precious souls, by continuing on the
                same terms of friendship with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>.‚Äô </p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>A few months subsequent to the proceedings related in the chapter immediately following [read:
                preceding, SN] this; and after Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> had been fairly admitted
                a member on trial in the. Wesleyan body for she could not be admitted into full membership since she was
                living, as was considered, in a state of concubinage, the Revd. <span
                        class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span> called to see Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, and demanded to have some talk with him in private. This
                being granted the missionary commenced:</p>

            <p>‚ÄòYou really must excuse the liberty I am going to take with you. Don‚Äôt be offended at what I am going to
                say to you; but consider it as a word prompted by a spirit of friendship, and an ardent desire for your
                real happiness.‚Äô</p>

            <p> ‚ÄòSince I parge to this country, and became acquainted with you I have found in you all that one could
                desire or expect from or in a friend. You have doubtless found in my frequent visits to you more than to
                any body else, in the many rides and walks we have had together; and in the pleasure I always take in
                your company, that I hold you in great esteem. But there is one thing wanting to make our friendship
                more complete. As a missionary and a preacher of the Gospel, one whose business out here is to convert
                souls, I would be wanting in my duty were I not to speak to you on your spiritual concerns. It is true,
                and I am glad to say, that your attendance in chapel on Sundays is very regular; that speaks well for
                you. If you had been a professed Christian instead of nominal one you could not have paid more attention
                to the words that fall from the mouth of the preacher. I have watched you often whilst preaching. If
                therefore you could cast in your lot among us and become a professed Christian I shall be happy indeed
                and I need not say I shall be happier in your company.‚Äô </p>

            <p> ‚ÄòBeing a professed Christian, I suppose you mean becoming a class member,‚Äô inquired Mr <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>.</p>

            <p>‚ÄòCertainly‚Äô replied <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span>. ‚ÄòAnd what could prevent you from
                being one? I have been told by Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, with whom I have on
                several occasions spoken about you that you have a strong antipathy to class meetings. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòYour colleague is right in telling you so, dear <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span>,‚Äô replied
                Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. ‚ÄòAs an individual I do not think it serves me a bit in my
                aspirations to act according to the dictates of conscience. Often have I done violence to the secret
                whisperings of that ‚Äúlittle insect in my head,‚Äù conscience, and have become a class member and as often
                broken my resolutions to be one. Mr </p>

            <p><span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> himself can tell you this. It is experience and not
                ignorance of the thing that makes me somewhat shy. I am afraid you will not find it an easy task to
                induce me to become one. </p>

            <p>'What is your real objection, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>? tell me; I may probably find
                some arguments in its favour to make it all right; for I am determined on having you Nolens, Volens."
            </p>

            <p>'Am I to understand that I am to speak freely, unconstrainedly, without giving offence by any words that
                I may have occasion to use, Hardy?' asked Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. </p>

            <p>'Of course you can say anything you like, barring indecent words or unchristian expressions,' replied the
                minister. </p>

            <p>"There is no fear of that dear Hardy. I have too great a respect for myself to be guilty of such
                ill-breeding. As an institution among many that the great founder of the sect - Mr Wesley-brought
                about,' continued <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, class meeting deserves to be ranked among
                the best; but it, like many schemes originally established with the best of intentions has been
                frightfully abused. Now as to the objections - and there are many - that I have against it. First, I
                really can not find it in my conscience to confess my sins to a man who is by nature as frail and as
                sinful as myself; and to confess them too before several other persons. For instance, I am required at
                the meeting to tell my feelings and experience during the week. Well, suppose during the week I
                committed adultery; rabbed a neighbour of a very valuable property; or accused a man, whom I hated, of a
                crime of which he was innocent, whereby his good character or reputation was ruined. Who, but a mad man
                would go to the meeting, before a whole lot of people and tell his leader at their hearing the feelings
                which prompted him during the week to commit such crimes; and with the knowledge too that some of the
                parties present might be a friend, a relative, or the very party or parties against whom the crime was
                committed? Is it not beyond the pale of human nature to do so? My dear friend if you can prove to me and
                to my satisfaction that this is possible and that it is within those things which a human being can
                accomplish I must submit even if it is against my conviction.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>‚ÄòThat, what you have been describing is against human nature I must agree with you' remarked <span
                    class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span>; 'and therefore it is that members are not required to
                confess the sins or crimes they may have committed during the week. That would be preposterous. </p>

            <p>'What then are they required to do at the meeting' demanded <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>?
            </p>

            <p>"They have only to tell what God has done for them during the week, the temptations to which they have
                been subjected; praying to God to give them Jesus. grace and strength to resist the devil and to
                increase their faith in the Lord Jesus. ‚ÄòIf this is the sole object of the meeting, I must acknowledge
                that I have nothing to say against it,‚Äô replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; ‚Äòbut I cannot
                help observing as I mentioned before, that the scheme has been frightfully abused. I have heard class
                members who at the meeting confess, nay, boast that their sins were forgiven; and say that if they died,
                there and then, they would go to heaven. Yet I have seen many turn out the poor and the needy from their
                doors; cheat the widow and the orphan out of their inheritance; many who would not assist an unfortunate
                but worthy man, to recover himself, because if they did, they would be helping him to raise himself to
                an independent position which they hate; who would run down and severely backbite their neighbour
                because they envy him; who w‚Äôld pretend sincere friendship towards a fellow whilst they secretly hate
                him, and would do him an injury if they could. Have I not seen them seduce other people‚Äôs wives? Oh God!
                can a pious institution like this be made the instrument of such wickedness‚Äô exclaimed <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, not a little excited. Seeing that the minister was quiet
                and not immediately inclined to speak, he continued, ‚Äòcan you wonder that knowing all these, I should
                shew such great disinclination to join that meeting or be a member thereof? would it not be by far
                better for me to confess any sin or crime that I commit to my minister, who like a doctor, and a
                gentleman is bound to my secret and who could know the nature of my disease - the crime or sin committed
                - be able to give me wholesome advice, and pray with or for me; than going to class meetings and there
                saying that I am what I am not; have done that which I have never done, or ever thought of doing; and
                adding sin to sin, thus aggravating the commission of one sin, where other persons - say even the
                heathens - only commit it once. A man commits an unworthy act; that act is a sin against God for which
                he can repent and ask Him to forgive him. But instead of that he goes to the meeting, and either tells
                his leader that he is a sinner, which he has no occasion to do since by nature we are all sinners or on
                the other hand, brags that he stands square with God and has made his election sure. Does he not
                aggravate the one sin that he has committed by deceiving God, his leader, his fellow members and him-
                self, besides the lies that he tells or the cloak that he puts on by general confession of his sinful
                nature for which there is no necessity? This is the honest confession of my feelings against class
                meetings generally. If after this you still wish me to join it, and you shew me how, I shall be only too
                glad and happy to submit to your advice.‚Äô </p>

            <p>I must say that when a man wilfully sets his heart against anything, however good and unexceptionable
                that thing may be, it were easier to remove the mountain than convince him,‚Äô replied <span
                        class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span>. ‚ÄòHowever I am still bent on having you amongst us and
                will therefore do this with you. At the meetings you will not be asked to tell your feelings unless you
                particularly wish to do so yourself; and at any time you wish to tell me anything that troubles your
                mind or are desirous of having a religious talk with me I shall only be too glad to accord to the
                chance. Will this satisfy you? I do not think you will have anything to say against this.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòPerfectly,‚Äô answered Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, ‚Äòand you may consider me now as a
                member of the society.‚Äô </p>

            <p>A little time after this as the two friends were talking about other matters I which need no record here.
                Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> passed. She was told by the Rev. gentleman of what had
                taken place and that she might consider her man as one of them; upon which she expressed her
                thankfulness and left. Before <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span> left he told Mr <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> that the next important subject that he would talk to him
                about would be in reference to Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>; that he knew that was a
                delicate matter; but as Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> had told him that the lady would
                not be averse to her being married to him in the church provided he also would like it and considering
                that he was now a member of this (ministers‚Äô) class, he would have some talk with him on the subject
                D.V.22 to-morrow. The friends then separated, <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span> being
                satisfied with himself for having succeeded in gaining over Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>
                to join the Society. As for Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> himself it could not be made
                out whether he was pleased or not with the rash promise he had given, for he sat down for sometime
                cogitating deeply. He however got up afterwards and went to his wife‚Äôs apartment where he found her busy
                dressing her hair.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>We recorded at the conclusion of the last chapter that Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> went
                to his wife‚Äôs apartment after the minister had left and that he met her adjusting her hair. He waited
                until she had finished, then got her to dismiss the girl who had been assisting her with her hair, and
                in a most lively and interesting manner opened up a conversation.</p>

            <p>‚ÄòMy dear girl, you really must be uncommonly pleased with me to-day. Now tell the truth.‚Äô ‚ÄòWhy should I
                be satisfied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and with ‚Äî‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòStop a bit‚Äô he interrupted laughing, ‚Äòand with yourself too prodigiously?‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòHow and why? you most wicked man,‚Äô demanded Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. ‚ÄòCurb your
                impatience a little, Madame,‚Äô continued he tauntingly; ‚Äòyou will know it in due course of time. You are
                not only pleased with me and yourself, but I can see that you are moreover pleased with and thankful iu
                the minister for what he has done to-day.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòWhat has he done? and why should I be pleased with it? don‚Äôt be foolish,‚Äô cried Miss <span
                    class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. ‚ÄòIf you have got anything to tell me be quick about it, for I
                have got no time to waste upon such a naughty man like you.‚Äô Whilst talking she was all the time looking
                at his face to ascertain whether he was joking with her or was in real earnest. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòYou women are strange; your contradictions and denials are admissions and affirmations; your yes‚Äôs are
                no‚Äôs. Why, my good lady, I could see plainly in your countenance these words written in prominent
                characters - ‚ÄúThe good minister has achieved a most praiseworthy act for which I must thank him. If it
                was not indelicate for a lady to kiss a gentleman, half a dozen kisses from me would not be enough, but
                I will make such a nice cake for him - and I know well how to make one - and send it. It will be a
                modest recognition of his kindness this day.‚Äù Now confess that I am right in my conjecture.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòCease troubling me with your nonsense, Mr Incorrigible. Now that I think fit, and two persons can play
                the same game, I will confess this much to you. I heard the minister say that he will come over again
                tomorrow. I have made up my mind to give him double the number of kisses you say you can read on the
                forehead of my face; and as many more to Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> for which
                purpose you found me busy adjusting my hair. I intended then to dress and call over to see him in order
                to effect this." </p>

            <p>‚ÄòA thousand thunders!‚Äô exclaimed <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, not a little taken back: ‚ÄòI
                would rather see the two worthy ministers further away from the scene! You really could not mean it!'
            </p>

            <p>'Now Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,' continued she, teasingly, 'are not the kisses my own
                and have I not the right to shower them upon any good man I please? They are not yours; what can you
                have to say about or against it, you good for nothing man!' You are wrong, my dear girl, terribly wrong!
                It is true that the kisses are your own; but is it not equally true that I have bought a monopoly over
                them so far as you are concerned? and that nobody can share with me the gratification thereat? You can
                not give them away without tearing them one by one from my heart."</p>

            <p>'From your heart; you say this? and do you feel it?' she asked seriously enough 'And yet you did not
                consider my heart when you showered upon, and literally smothered Miss with the kisses which are mine by
                monopoly also as you called it yesterday at Mr Fabrah's. Don't you think that women are endued with the
                same heart and sentiments as men? It was to pay you in your own coins that I was preparing to go Mr
                <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>'s to thank him with kisses for what he had done and the
                white minister for what he did yesterday. </p>

            <p>'Not too fast, my dear, not too fast,' cried Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, not knowing
                how to take her words, whether to take them seriously or not. He however denied the charge of having
                kissed Miss - and ended by asking his wife whether she really meant what she said. </p>

            <p>I mean every word I have told you; as also the number of kisses I intend for those two gentlemen. Mean
                it! Well it was told me by a person who was present when you kissed the young woman.' </p>

            <p>And who was the person who told you?' demanded he, perfectly bewildered. </p>

            <p>'Not so fast, my dear,' said she exultingly, repeating her husband's words, and then as silently as
                possible adding, 'tit for tat, my precious boy. You are in an unusually teasing mood to-day, my girl,'
                he cried. </p>

            <p>It is a contagious disease my dear young man,' she replied; 'you see I am more polite than you are. I
                qualify the word man with the adjective young. </p>

            <p>'I am puzzled!' exclaimed the unfortunate man gradually getting heated. 'Have I known you for these long
                years and never found out the real stuff of which you are composed?' </p>

            <p>'Have I also known you for these many years,' she replied, 'without finding out that you are a pitiless
                teaser?'</p>

            <p>'Now let us do away with these profitless quibbles,' he then exclaimed. Just give me the name of the
                party from whom you gleaned the information that I was free in another person's company and who told
                such extraordinary lies about me and whether you him. </p>

            <p>'Not until you pay for the information' she answered, pitilessly interrupting </p>

            <p>'And whether you really mean to go out, and to Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>'s too,
                with the intention of ‚Äî well you know what I mean,' continued the man in his anxiety to know her real
                feelings, and disregarding her demand for payment of the information</p>

                            <p>‚ÄòLet it out man, let out the word,' she said in a taunting manner, then added, ‚ÄòYes I meant to kiss him,

            <p>‚ÄòAnd the white person?‚Äô continued he without taking notice of what his wife had said. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòHim I will certainly kiss with double the number of kisses unless you pay me well for that also!‚Äô </p>

            <p> ‚ÄòMust I pay yea for the simple information, and for preventing you from doing that which it is base for
                a respectable woman to do? You really are to-day much disposed to make money, <span

            <p>‚ÄòWho said that I wanted money,‚Äô interrupted the lady; ‚Äòand your money too! as if I did not consider that

            <p>‚ÄòBut what is it you want? I would rather satisfy you than to continue this fruitless pass of words,‚Äô
                humbly gave in Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòFruitless indeed! Acknowledge now honestly that you have had the worse of it, and that in future you
                will respect my sex, however illiterate I may be, and treat me better than you have treated me to-day.
                Women‚Äôs denials and contradictions, their affirmations, indeed! as if men are the only creatures that
                were made to tell exactly what they mean or feel. ‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòBy the <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>! I have caught a Tartar to-day and no mistake! Well
                I shall now give in; tell me 'the name of your informant! ‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòWell I also will give in,‚Äô she said, repeating her husband‚Äôs very words. ‚ÄòI shall have pity on you. Now
                tell me what it was that <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span> told you which has brought on
                your poor head the nest of hornets?‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòI have promised to be a member of his class; he told you so himself. Are you not glad my <span
                    class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>?‚Äô </p>

            <p>I? No! Why should 1 be glad? You are rather wrong if you thought so. ‚ÄúThe soul that sinneth it shall
                die.‚Äù231 have my own soul to think or take care of, my dear husband. I do not see why I should be so
                uncommonly glad.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòHow unfeelingly you do talk to-day, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>,‚Äô replied poor <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, quite beside himself. I really thought you would rejoice at it,
                and so came in to have a chat with you about it and about another matter which he told me. But I see now
                that you never cared for me,‚Äô said he getting up to go away. </p>

            <p>Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> seeing her husband in the miserable plight she had put
                him into, got up hastily and encircled her plump arms round his neck and gave him the kisses which she
                intended for the two persons, but which she really never intended to give them, and submissively begged
                him to forgive her. Mr <span class="personal-name">Mr Quaibu</span> reseated himself and was restored to
                the spirits in which he first went to his wife‚Äôs apartment, by her telling him that she merely assumed
                that attitude to punish him for daring to tease her, and treating her in a manner he never did before.
            </p>

            <p>‚ÄòThen I must not believe a single word of what you said,‚Äô said Mr <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> quite himself again. ‚ÄòNo Mr <span
                    class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,‚Äô she answered, feeling really proud of her success in teasing
                her liege Lord and bringing him to her feet.</p>

            <p>‚ÄòNor, my having kissed the young woman too?‚Äô again asked he. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòThat also has no existence but in my brains,‚Äô she replied. </p>

            <p>And the kisses to the persons?‚Äô he again asked looking keenly at her. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòFie! Did you really believe that I was really capable of committing such an unwomanly act? That shows me
                how very lightly you think of me and how very low you consider my morals to be. However let us forget
                what has passed and talk about the interesting subject which, I do not deny now, does occupy my mind,
                and at which I cannot help rejoicing. When I was a member and you were not, I felt, as it were, that we
                were separated by a deep chasm but now that you have become one, that wicked barrier is removed-and we
                are close to each other again.‚Äô </p>

            <p> I see that you are yourself again, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>,‚Äô returned her husband;
                ‚Äòand as you know that I do not wish to be in debt I will pay you back the kisses you gave me.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòHave done, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,‚Äô cried Miss <span
                    class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. releasing herself at the same time from her spouse. ‚ÄòIf you
                go on at this rate you will not have any more left with me to pay you for the other information you
                promised to give me.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòWhat information did I promise you, my dear?‚Äô asked he. ‚ÄòI certainly do not recollect it. ‚Äô ‚ÄòDo you wish
                to travel upon the same road again, my dear <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>? Have you so soon
                forgotten how grievously you missed your way? and but for me you would be still wandering, wandering
                until you got benighted?‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòHonor bright, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>; I certainly do not recollect giving you
                promise of any information,‚Äô replied he. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòNor do you know anything else besides joining the society, which you and the minister talked about
                to-day?‚Äô </p>

            <p> ‚ÄòI see it now, by the <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>! Ah! you women as you sat here whilst
                the minister and myself were in the hall talking, of course you could not hear a word of what we were
                talking about. Could, you <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>? Well, there is <span <span
                        class="personal-name-3"><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span></span> and Miss Butah
                your friend sitting down in the hall talking and I can hear every word they utter, although they are not
                talking loud. Now acknowledge that you heard it whilst we were talking and that you did not hear it from
                me. </p>

            <p> Acknowledge this and as soon as our visitors are gone we will have a quiet ‚Äúconfab‚Äù about it, and I will
                tell you also my views on the matter, which will place you in a position to judge.‚Äô</p>

                            <p>‚ÄòI shall give in <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; but I sincerely wish your friend Mr<span
                    class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> and his wife will not stay long so that we may resume
                our conversation. I am so impatient to know all about it.‚Äô</p>

            <p> They joined Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> and his companion who seemed on the
                pins to get away as the sun was getting too hot she said, and they had a long way to go. Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> was not a little pleased, but had the good grace to press
                her companion to wait until the cool of the evening. <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> however
                for obvious reasons was so pressing on Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> that he at
                last consented to wait. He had to go to Nouveau Vue on a little business with the judge, but Mrs<span
                        class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> (no 5) had to go a long way as she was going to
                Eksbury.</p>

            <p>What is the news of the day?‚Äô enquired <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> of his friend. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòThere is no particular news that I am aware of,‚Äô he at first answered, but subsequently added, ‚Äòby the
                bye, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, have you received any note from <span
                        class="personal-name-12">Mr Cleighmore</span>? I went over to see him this morning on business,
                and whilst there I saw a lot of notes addressed to a few friends. I took mine and found it an invitation
                to dinner at his house tomorrow evening.‚Äô</p>

            <p> ‚ÄòAnother dinner party! exclaimed <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> rather sorrowful. ‚ÄòThese
                repeated dinner parties don‚Äôt agree with me. I wish I could discover a plausible excuse with a view to
                be absent.‚Äô </p>

            <p> ‚ÄòWhat is up old fellow?‚Äô demanded his friend. ‚ÄòDo you wish to withdraw from our clique? You will have a
                tough job to accomplish, I can assure you.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòOh no, that was not my intention when I said that. But you must acknowledge that we had really too much
                of it lately, and I was never accustomed to such a dissipated course before I came here.‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòBe off 'with you,‚Äô exclaimed <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. ‚ÄòTo talk of dissipation.
                Is there any place more ‚Äúdissipated‚Äù than your <span class="place-name-cape-coast"><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Coast" target="_blank">Cape Coast</a></span>?</p>

            <p>‚Äò<span Class-"place-name-1">Dobblesie</span> is certainly a ‚Äúdissipated‚Äù town, but it is quite a quiet
                place when compared to that town of yours. <span Class-"place-name-2">Gangacre</span> is notoriously
                known to be the jolliest town in our part of the coast; you must acknowledge that, <span
                        class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòThere is a letter for you and another for my master Edward,‚Äô interrupted <span class="personal-name-30">Aghastone</span>
                the head servant of Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, who handed the letters and with- drew.
                The very identical note of invitation from Cleighmore' exclaimed <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; 'What a good job it is, it is for to-morrow. I have time to
                turn it over in my head whether I shall go or not.'</p>

            <p>'But you must go <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, or we will know the reason why' exclaimed
                <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. 'We don't do things by halves here as you of <span
                        Class-"place-name-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Coast"</a>Dobblesie</span>.
                What a nuisance!' he exclaimed after glancing at his letter. 'I suppose I must go after all, and to the
                very place I was trying to avoid in this hot time. The judge wish- es to see me at once at his
                residence.' </p>

            <p>'Wont you take something cooling <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> before you leave?'
                asked <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. </p>

            <p>'No' thanks. I must keep a clear head before His Honor. I don't know what tough matter he is going to
                speak to me about, and I have not forgotten the wet- ting you gave me. </p>

            <p>'Good bye then for the present. Are you also going?' addressing himself to Mrs <span
                    class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. 'Can't your friend persuade you to stay until the cool
                of the evening?' </p>

            <p>'I have done all I could,' put in Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, 'to induce her to
                stay, but go she must, she says. She promises to come over to-morrow evening to spend the time with me
                whilst you are away. </p>

            <p>'Whilst I am away! where to?' asked <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. </p>

            <p>'Read that note in your hands again,' replied <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. </p>

            <p>'Oh I have forgotten. But you seem to be very anxious for me to go to the dinner, Miss. Well good bye Mrs
                <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>; I hope to see you again to-mor- row evening??</p>

            <p>'You will not see her then, for you wont be at home,' insisted Miss <span
                    class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. 'What a curious girl you are!' <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>
                could only say. </p>

            <p>As soon as the <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>s left Miss <span
                    class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> insisted upon resuming their private talk, and to have it
                over, so to the old place they went. It certainly must be confessed that do whatever he would poor <span
                        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> could not make himself out, much less Miss <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. The lady had shown a change, or decided to change since
                she became a class member; and may not the contemplated Church marriage effect greater changes in her
                against his peace of mind? As man he thought if he did not assume his right position at the eve of the
                bond soon to be contracted between himself and her, he might as well cast his authority to the winds
                after the celebration of the marriage, and submit himself to be hen-pecked for life. He thought better
                therefore to make a resolute stand and refuse to discuss the subject until he thought fit and proper to
                do so. On the other hand he thought that if he refused to have it out then his chance of doing so before
                the promised interview with the minister on the next day would be lost and without having the talk over
                with her so as by it a result to know whether or not he would be studying his and her future happiness
                by consenting to the project, he would be leaping in the dark and plunging her and himself into
                life-long misery. He therefore chose the least of the two evils and quietly submitted with good grace to
                the discussion of their second marriage. Poor man! He was in a sad predicament. To have the talk there
                and then he would be giving in to his wife which he did not wish to do; and not to do so, he either must
                give the minister his promise to marry in the Church in which case he would be acting blindly in the
                affair or if he refused he felt that he must give him - the minister - good and sufficient reasons for
                refusing which he could not do without first having an interview with her. The lady therefore carried
                the day, and nothing loathe opened the ball by asking <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> to tell
                her what the minister told him.</p>

                            <p>Are you indeed very anxious to know it? 'he asked, cautiously approaching the subject.</p>

            <p>‚ÄòHow provoking you are now <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; you know very well that I am very
                anxious; what is the use of asking?‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòTo come again to the point <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. He showed me a superb ring which
                was said was a present from Her Majesty the Queen to her beloved subject, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>,
                of whom she had heard a great deal, and the <span class="personal-name-knight"><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight" target="_blank">Knight</a></span>hood to her
                subject, even your beloved husband, on condition that we perform a certain meritorious deed which he the
                minister mentioned.‚Äô</p>

            <p>‚ÄòAlthough I find that you are joking with me, and that you would learn no lesson by what took place at
                our last interview, yet as I am really anxious to know what it was I will condescend to ask you what the
                conditions were by the performance of which I would be entitled to the ring, and you to the title of
                knighthood. ‚Äô </p>

            <p> I am not joking, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. I have told you exactly what he said.
                However if you don‚Äôt comprehend it I will be more explicit. The mystic ring is the emblem of marriage. I
                am to have the custody thereof for the present, until the time come when I shall have to give it to you
                in chapel, before the ordained minister and witnesses. The order of knighthood is an honourable title
                conferred upon nobody else but those who are of good reputation, high respectability and of good
                position. The fact of this title being conferred upon me does not only shew that I have hitherto been
                worthy of it but through our future life I must maintain its respectability by which alone I shall be
                considered by all classes of men as a respectable member of society This is the idea of Christians. Now,
                as women generally share the dignity of their husbands, so they also become F highly respectable as soon
                as ever the ring is transferred from the husband to the wife, and it is their bounden duty to help the
                man to keep it always respectable, and without whom it is utterly impossible. You may ask, how is it
                that the Queen of <span Class-"place-name-3">England</span> has to do with marriages generally? Know
                that she is the head of the Protestant faith, represents God on earth, her name is only mentioned in
                this light; but as I am a creature of God who has made me What 1 am by implanting in me an earnest
                desire to acquire a position of worth and respectability among Christian communities in particular, and
                in this world generally, I consider that what I am and what I have, including the ring and the order or
                knighthood (emblem of respectability) are as it were presents from him and him only through his vicar on
                earth which is the Queen, Defender of the Faith. Are you satisfied that I was not joking? and do you
                understand now what it was that the minister was asking me?‚Äô </p>

            <p> ‚ÄòI understand you perfectly; but I must say, however, that I do not fully comprehend the part Her
                Majesty has to do in the matter. I do not think that you do understand yourself, although you have been
                trying hard to make the best of it. I am, however, satisfied there is an end of it. By the by, Bonsoe
                Kumah, do you intend going to <span class="personal-name-12">Mr Cleighmore</span>‚Äôs dinner?‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòAway with dinners,‚Äô cried <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> surprised. ‚ÄòIs it possible that you
                are ignorant of the seriousness of the matter into which we are plunging? I see by the light way you
                take it that your friend, the minister, and his wife have only shewn you its bright and pleasant side;
                and have kept from you either intentionally or not, its dark, hideous and most miserable side. I will
                not allow you to undertake an affair of such a nature with your eyes shut, and I will endeavour to
                explain it to you in the best way I can, leaving you to decide or take what course you please. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòI cannot give you an elaborate elucidation of the thing, as I am not clever 1 enough to do so; but
                whatever I know about it I will endeavour to explain to N you so that you may be in a position to decide
                whether we are not happier as we are in our native marriage than we would be in the Church one.</p>

            <p>‚ÄòWe are going to stand before God, and each of us is to take a solemn Oath in the presence of the
                minister who is to marry us, and before witnesses. I have to swear, on my part, that I will keep you and
                you only as my legal wife, and that I will never take or keep another woman besides yourself as long as
                I live. I have to swear further, that I will support and protect you in sickness and everything in which
                by nature, women are specially weak to and respect you as well as I do myself and to cause others to
                respect you by my own conduct and behaviour towards you. As far as I am concerned I shall find the new
                state very easy enough; in fact I can see no difference between the way I have hitherto treated you and
                that which I shall be enjoined by the new tie. The only difference I can see is, as we are now situated
                you can leave me at any time. And I can send you away also at any time. This embraces the principle if
                not the entire duty towards you as a husband. You on your part will have to swear that you will honour,
                love and obey me in all lawful commands, and that you will respect me above all men excepting perhaps
                your father. This you will find easy enough to do since you have practised it during the 8 years of our
                connection. If this was all we would have nothing whatsoever to fear, and can have no apprehension as to
                the wreck of our mutual happiness. What we have now to be very anxious about and of which 1 have the
                great dread is the substitution o/ that with has hitherto proved efficacious in keeping us to our duty
                towards each other, for that which may not equally prove powerful enough to produce the same effect.
                That which has hitherto kept us together is our having been left alone to act as we choose or in other
                words, the liberty we have of ridding our- selves of each other at any time we mind to. This may seem
                strange not only to you but to a great many persons who may not have had serious thought about the
                matter; but it is nevertheless true according to my own individual convictions. The free-will implanted
                in us by God to act as we think proper, would be fraught with evil, in fact act banefully in our
                marriage life had it not been something else which is extremely strong in its nature to keep it within
                bound. For instance in our case. From the time that we lived as man and wife up to the present time, it
                is little more than eight years; during all this time option has been granted to either of us to live as
                we commenced, or to separate. I have elected' to have you always with me, and have felt that if you
                leave me I shall feel very miserable. What must I do to have you always to live with me? It is nothing
                more or less than to love and cherish you, to treat you kindly and with the utmost consideration, to
                anticipate your very wants, and, in every way to treat you with the greatest respect and affection. If I
                did not behave in such a manner towards you could you have lived so long with me? Never. It is against
                human nature. Well, it is because I stand a chance of losing you therefore it is that I have been
                constrained to show you all these considerations; and I am sure if father, mother or any other persons,
                or influences were to rise up to break the connection between us, as we are now situated, you would not
                listen to them. You would rather, I am sure /eave your father and mother, and cleave unto me, for you
                have become bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh (Gen. Chap II verse 23-4). This is the real marriage,
                the grand DIVINE UNION - marriage - ordained by God, between a man and a woman. It is pure, unalloyed,
                and free from the contamination of all extraneous influences. On your part, it is just the same. If you
                did not show me all what I have already enumerated, if you did not behave towards me in a way in which a
                wife ought to behave towards her husband, we should have separated long ago. As in my case so have you
                been afraid of the power that I have of sending you away. This is the whole principle of country
                marriage, as far as monogamy goes, and I would, not give it up in exchange for another if I can help
                myself. But it may be asked what about the liberty that the man has" of taking unto himself more than
                one wife? The answer is simple; a man of religious principles and a gentleman who really and truly
                respects himself would rather have but one wife, provided that that wife is all that he desires in her,
                than to have more than one, which would be a source of discomfort and misery in his house</p>

                            <p>‚ÄòYou have seen, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, the liberty, the freedom of action, enjoyed
                in country marriages. I will tell you now that for which we are going to sacrifice what has heretofore
                been a source of happiness and bliss to us.' ‚ÄòLiberty is sweet, and natural laws are stronger than laws
                that any civil power can inaugurate. The marriage I have just described to you is full of liberty,
                because it is nature's institution or something near it; whilst free will or liberty has no place in the
                one I am going to describe to you; because it is a civil institution opposed to nature. It is this: we
                swear before God and man that nothing but adultery committed by one or both of us could dissever the
                connection between us; otherwise we must live together through life whether or not I treat you kindly.
                In this one, the oath that we take to bind us together - a very sharp instrument for people living as we
                are, to handle - takes the place of liberty and free will or action of the other. In the country
                marriage the love is fed continually by the FEAR that at the least ill-treatment your wife or your
                husband might leave you, and marry another; in the church marriage there is no such incentive manages
                with us there. Whilst in the one (native marriage) we have every reason to be careful how we act, in the
                other, license is given to us to do whatever we like. The woman is at liberty to say "I can do whatever
                I like now, so long as my husband can not of his own wish and inclination divorce me unless he can prove
                adultery against me. Now love may go to the winds; I will enjoy myself the best way I can" [quotation
                marks added, SN]. With love, obedience, honor and respect far away the poor miserable dupe of a husband
                gets his eyes open when it is too late for him to retract. The man may lose the love he had for the wife
                for the like reasons, although he may show her respect for her own sake, and keep outward appearances.
                The man, besides other miseries that he has it in his power to inflict upon his wife, cannot help
                treating her differently from the kind of treatment he gave her before marriage. Then if he showed his
                true colours his lady love being unshackled could give him his cong√©; but now that she is enchained, for
                any act of his towards her barring brutal treatment and adultery, he may not care. In the church
                marriages, according to the state of our society license is given us to make each other miserable, while
                in the country one the license given is in the other way. Now <span
                        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> you have heard all what I have told you about these two
                kinds of marriages; I will leave you now to think of it; let me know your decision before the minister
                makes his intended visit tomorrow.' </p>

            <p>I really must thank you,' replied Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, 'for the trouble at
                which you have been to explain the nature of the two marriages to me. But if church marriage is as bad
                as you have depicted it, how is it that all white men in their country go by it?'</p>

            <p>You are right to ask me that question,' replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. 'It would take
                me too long to explain all the reasons to you. Enough if I tell you that whilst it has taken more than a
                thousand years to make the white men what they are now, we, on our side cannot count even one hundred;
                so you will easily perceive that their ways so far as the present is concerned are not our ways, neither
                does that which suit them necessarily suit us. When I speak of church marriages I mean as they concern
                us in this country. </p>

            <p>'But I see many legally married couples who live happily together even in our country; why should not
                others?' asked Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. 'As for instance who my dear girl?'
                replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>.</p>

            <p> ‚ÄòAs for instance, Rev Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> and his wife, <span
                    class="personal-name-26">Hon Coontarmas</span>, <span class="personal-name-27">Mr Gandor</span> and
                many others,‚Äô she replied. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòAllow me to know more about these gentlemen than yourself, my dear, but you do well to instance the few
                whom you consider to be the bright side of the picture; and now I will not go beyond our own family to
                bring out the dark side of your picture. What about your aunt and my daddy? Your aum Jemima and her
                husband; your uncle <span class="personal-name-28">Quantamak</span> and his wife; your uncle <span
                        class="personal-name-29">Mensah</span> and ‚Äî‚Äô </p>

            <p>‚ÄòEnough!‚Äô cried Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> suddenly, looking quite bewildered.
                ‚ÄòThese are really sad instances you have named. To tell you the real truth you have thoroughly convinced
                me. But what am I to do? I have not only consented but 1iave also promised to use my influence, if I had
                any with you, to get you to join the class meetings, and the consummation of this second marriage. </p>

            <p>‚ÄòEnough <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. If you are still willing after the explanation of
                the two kinds of marriages I have given you, to change the one for the other, I have nothing more to
                say. I am satisfied if you are. May God help us,‚Äô replied Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>

                            <p>At the meeting that took place between the minister and Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> the next day, at
    which marriage formed the principal topic of conversation, I mean discussion, our hero not being inclined to give up
    the happiness which he enjoyed in his country marriage state without at least showing to the minister his opinion of
    the two kinds of marriages, used more forcible arguments than he used when he was with his wife. Mr <span
            class="personal-name-19">Powers</span> on his side used all the arguments he could in favour of church or
    Christian marriage; but he found that he might as well try to convince him that black was white. Finding however
    that he was going to lose <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, since it was obvious to him that he could not
    admit him as a class member until he consummated his marriage in the church, Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>
    said: </p>

<p>‚ÄòBy the arguments you have urged forward in favour of country marriage a good portion of which I cannot help
    admitting to be convincing, I infer that you mean to live as you are with your lady. If such be the case, what about
    the promise you gave me yesterday of becoming a member of our Society? For you really, as you must be aware, cannot
    be admitted whilst you live with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> in a state of concubinage - pardon
    the expression. ‚Äô</p>

<p>‚ÄòDear Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>‚Äô returned <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, ‚Äòyou must
    not consider me capable of giving a promise to day and breaking it tomorrow. Do not infer by the nature of my
    arguments that I have decided either the one or the other way. Custom or rather habit is second nature, and you
    cannot expect me to give up at once and without regret the marriage in which I have found such an unalloyed
    happiness during so many years, for one the consequences, or rather the operations of which, I really cannot tell.
    You say that 1 cannot be admitted as a member unless I conform to the rites of Christian marriage.‚Äô </p>

<p>‚ÄòThat is the rule of the Society; of course you are aware of that,‚Äô replied Mr <span
        class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>.

<p> ‚ÄòEven in spite of my having lived for so many years with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, sticking
    to her only, having conferred upon her all the respects that any church married woman can expect; a prey to no
    jealousies and heart burnings; one who has been able to command even your respect, strict methodist as you are? Even
    in spite of al! these which are no less than what could be expected in church marriages I must not be admitted into
    your society?‚Äô </p>

<p>‚ÄòEven so,‚Äô the Rev gentleman replied. </p>

<p>‚ÄòAm I then to understand‚Äô continued <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, that the master is more liberal than
    his disciples in the line of conduct he prescribed for them to pursue?‚Äô </p>

                            <p>'In the very subject which forms the principal topic of our conversation,' replied <span
        class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. 'Our Lord Jesus, although a God, yet conformed himself to the things of
    this world when he became incarnate. He would suit his divine precept and teachings to the condition of the people.
    Did he not command his disciples "to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that
    are God's"?" Did he not rebuke the Pharisees for charging his disciples with breach of the Sabbath and uphold his
    disciples? The Pharisees were astonished when he said the "Sabbath was made for man, but not man for the Sabbath."
    He knew that his disciples were hungry and therefore considered that it was no sin to pluck the ears of corn on a
    sabbath day to satisfy the cravings of nature. Certain it is that he would have blamed them and upheld the conduct
    of the Pharisees had the disciples no hunger to satisfy, but only committed the act through wantonness and on the
    Sabbath too. He ‚Äî</p>

<p>'But my dear fellow,' interrupted Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>, 'what has all this to do with the
    subject on hand?' </p>

<p>'Great deal sir,' replied he. 'I was going to say when you interrupted me that He, that is our Lord Jesus, would in
    this instance say, as in the case of the sabbath, that marriage was made for man and not man for marriage.</p>

<p>'How do you make this out? Where is the analogy? You are handling a subject you don't understand sir,' cried the
    parson very much excited. </p>

<p>'Quietly, my dear friend,' replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, 'quietly. Kindly hear me out and you
    can decide whether or not I understand the subject.' He then continued. 'I said that Christ would in this case have
    laid down the precept that 'marriage was made for man, and not man for marriage.' The analogy between the two is
    obvious. In the case of the disciples HUNGER was the reason of their being right in breaking the Sabbath to satisfy
    it. It was much better that, than for his disciples to suffer the inconvenience of hunger. Well, in the case of
    marriage you cannot deny that happiness is the chief end of it (marriage). Our Saviour would have seen that, since
    happiness would not result in christian marriages among half-barbarous people, pure monogamy, without the oath,
    would have been a happy substitute; he would have told the Pharisees that marriage was made for man instead of the
    man being made for it. It does not serve my purpose to enter fully into this part of the subject at present; I will
    leave it and then enter into the principal topic of our conversation. </p>

<p>'You tell me that I cannot be admitted into your society because the relation between me and Miss <span
        class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> is an obstacle in the way. To be admitted I must either marry her
    according to the Church or send her away in order to entitle myself to membership. To send her away, I find is
    impossible, in fact it would be wicked; it is not to be thought of; and to take her to Church I find I cannot:
    because we are not ripe enough for such a ceremony; the nature of our society would not admit of it yet I have
    assured you that if the object of the English . marriage be to ensure happiness, I am satisfied that peace and joy
    are sufficiently ensured by our country marriages too, however ridiculous they may appear in the eyes of the
    stranger, and that by forcing people into this kind of marriage, it would be placing a sharp instrument in the hands
    of ignorant people to cut their throat with, that is loss of their happiness. But you have no middle course; it must
    be ‚Äúyea, yea, or nay, nay.‚Äù The same rule is applicable in a society which has taken centuries to perfect, in a
    community the most civilized, and where morality is at the highest pitch and as pure as it can be; you say the same
    rule must apply in a country the most degraded, in a society the most loose, and amongst a people just emerging from
    the shade of barbarism n whose I morals may be the lowest in the world. You say there is no middle course with l
    you. With the Saviour himself He would have found a way to suit existing circumstances and allowed time to do the
    work. I feel that I am rushing into a thing which will surely land me and the poor woman into a complete wreck of
    happiness. If my wife had not been completely made to take your view of the matter and had I been a complete master
    of the occasion, as it had been mine before she became a member and was stuffed with this precious marriage, I would
    most certainly use my right as a man; and refuse the thing point blank. But she is entirely for it; and as I myself
    cannot be admitted into the Wesleyan body as you tell me, without first entering into the church marriage, I cannot
    do anything else but give my consent thereto. Let it be done as speedily as possible.‚Äô </p>

<p>‚ÄòI must certainly say‚Äô, replied Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>, ‚Äòthat you unnecessarily entertain a
    most gloomy view of the case. You will find that if happiness was ensured you in your native marriage, double
    happiness will be the result of this one. Be assured that it would conduce to your happiness.‚Äô </p>

<p>‚ÄòYou have not been long in the country, Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>, to know the state of its
    society. In this instance you in this part have taken the one from Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>.
    We have known each other long enough, for you to know that, besides being a man of some education, I have had
    English principles ingrafted into me. You also know Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> to be a woman
    of no education and that her principles are purely native. How can you entertain the hope that you have just
    expressed to me? Being illiterate, and hardly understanding English, could you expect her to realize the seriousness
    of the step which she is now about to take. Let it be hoped however that you may be right and I wrong as to the
    result of the marriage. If during the discussion of this matter I have said anything out of the way kindly forgive
    me; for I really cannot help myself as I felt during the time and even now that I am rushing or being forced into an
    abyss where there is no way of getting out once in. Remember me in your prayers my dear friend for I am really
    miserable. May God help us.‚Äô </p>

<p>Nothing more was said about the matter, and the Rev gentleman left not feeling very happy about the result of the
    conversation he had with his friend. As for Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> himself his position in the
    affair was then the same. He met the parson with a mind fully made up to enter into the new marriage, but he wished
    to let him know that he entered into it with his eyes wide open. It is true that to him the FUTURE was unfathomable
    a puzzle; but he found consolation in the thought that God could temper the wind for the shorn lamb. <span
            class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> therefore felt, when the person went away, rather glad than otherwise
    that the matter was settled, even if it was against his good judgment. Poor <span
            class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>! better it would have been by far for you and Miss <span
            class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> had you made a resolute stand and refused to have anything to do with
    the marriage. Your after life would have been happier in the society of your lady love instead of the heart
    burnings, misery, inquietude and the life of annoyance and irritation you would have afterwards Let this be a lesson
    to those who are living in ‚Äòsingle life‚Äô or in the happy marriage of their country?"</p>

                            <p>It has been recorded somewhere that <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> at the meeting that took place
    between himself and Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> exhibited such extreme disapproval of the step his
    friend was about to take, that he spoke in undisguised terms his sentiments or mind on the rashness of the act, and
    that he cautioned him before he left io think over the matter again before he plunged himself into it. The meeting
    of the friends took place shortly after the conference which has been related as having taken place between Mr <span
            class="personal-name-19">Powers</span> and Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. It was impossible,
    therefore for him to arrive at any other conclusion than that which resulted at the meeting. He consequently told
    his friend when they next met of his having made up his mind to take the leap in the dark and abide by the
    consequences. <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> had done all that a friend could do; he could not
    overstep the bounds of friendship and act the despotic master towards a refractory f slave; he therefore tendered
    <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> his services and even offered to act as his best man, which office he
    performed creditably when the marriage was solemnized shortly after. There were no cooings for Mr and Mrs <span
            class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; they, as lovers, had done their cooings long, long ago; there was no
    honey-moon, nor any of the sweet nothings that newly married couples usually indulge in. To them nothing new was
    brought about by this new marriage. If anything was brought, it amounted to the two terms Mr and Mrs. </p>

<p>Dear Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>! Fain would I still call thee by thine own sweet name! May Mrs
    <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> never have occasion to regret the loss of her liberty, as she seems now
    not to regret the loss of her poetic name! Fare thee well sweet <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>! may the
    name <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> which thou hast assumed be as propitious to thee as that was to thee
    which thou hast cast away. And now gentle <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, to thee also I have aught to
    say of advice, give strict attention to it, and it will be of the greatest benefit to thee in the new life thou art
    going to lead. It is certain that thou art aware of the importance of the step thou hast taken, and that thy <span
            class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> does not understand it. It would be thy duty therefore to be
    forbearing and to exercise greater patience with her now than thou ever didst before. If you wish to be happy, learn
    to lead her gently in the new path she has entered into with you. She has a great deal to learn and much to unlearn;
    be a willing preceptor, and in the end, as you are aware that she is quick to learn, success will Attend your

                            <p>I have been‚Äô, began the old man ‚Äòa great traveller in my life. There is not country, a town of any note, in this vast
    continent of ours that I have not visited. The motives which first impelled me to be on the continual move I need no
    tell thee now; but for that motive I would not have travelled but certainly would have remained quiet at home, and
    lived among a people who honoured and respected me, as I was their chief. To look at me now you would not think that
    I could have been what I now represent myself to be, and yet such was truly the case. It happened one day as I was
    on my way to a certain town I fell in with a company of travellers who were going to the same place where I intended
    to rest for the night; we accordingly travelled together and from them I learnt that the great city for which I was
    bound - a city renowned for the splendour and magnificence of its buildings and for the great and prodigious amount
    of traffic carried on by its people with the adjacent as well as with the neighbouring countries as also for the
    great wisdom of its King was a three day journey from where I was. As I had heard much about this city and the
    wealth of its inhabitants, and as travellers were generally loud in their praises of that spot, 1 fully made up my
    mind to see it. This resolution was moreover the outcome of a desire to become acquainted with the superior manners,
    habits and customs of the inhabitants of the city. We reached a small town near it about dusk and having had a good
    rest during the night, I got up the next morning quite fresh and was in readiness to embrace the chance of a party
    of men who were going to that city with merchandize to sell. Although I had nothing in the shape of goods to sell
    yet my anxiety to reach the place as quickly as possible equalled that of the merchants; we therefore took two and a
    half instead of three days to accomplish the journey. I was fortunate enough to be conducted to good lodgings, the
    proprietor of which was very kind and civil to me. He took a great liking to me, and in course of time we became as
    thick friends as similarity of age - for we were about 30 years old then - temperament, and habits could make us. I
    am just turning to 65 years, so it is about 35 years since this happened. There was something in me which the man
    doubtless saw. He probably believed that if he cultivated an intimacy with me it would be to our mutual benefit. He
    subsequently engaged me in his business. As I had an aptitude for business, especially the kind of business in which
    he was engaged, he in course of time had occasion to thank his stars for having had my assistance, and I for having
    become acquainted with him, for his business increased and he soon had occasion to enlarge his establishment by
    adding new buildings to it, and engaging another one equally large to which he transferred me. In this situation I
    soon h contracted an acquaintance with people of note and good standing in the city. I J‚Äô took to myself a tutor
    from whom I learnt a great deal of what I was before ignorant and acquired such habits as only highly civilized
    communities could impart. My business did not only increase but prospered. I became a man of note and associated
    with the highest personages in the city. Things went on smoothly with me for many years, when one day, being seized
    with a great inclination to visit my native country, I took leave of my friend the proprietor to whom I entrusted
    the management of my affairs during my absence and from whom I departed with a good portion of the riches I had
    acquired, carried by many men and women and accompanied by some of my friends, who were desirous of seeing my
    country and people. I need not trouble you with a description of the nature of the reception I received From my
    people; suffice it to say that I did not repent having made the journey and my friends for accompanying me. For some
    years I remained with my people, during which time I introduced many improvements, effected changes in the habits
    and customs of my country and made such laws which I considered suitable to its circum- stances. After I had done
    all that was possible to be done I went back to my adopted country and found my friend the proprietor, completely
    changed in disposition, although not from a worldly point of view. He received me very warmly, and not a little to
    my surprise introduced me to a lady whom he called his wife. I experienced feelings of chillness during the time I
    was with my friend and his lady. Instead of the jolly friend I left a few years ago I met him ' looking rather
    haggard and miserable and I saw moreover that his civil manners towards me were forced "left Mn very much surprised
    and perplexed. I did not know what to think of him. I felt somewhat grieved. His friendship and love for me I could
    perceive had not in any way abated, but yet I felt a coldness, a numbness, which I could not make out. In this
    situation I took my leave of them but determined to get at the cause of this extraordinary change, and in future to
    shape my conduct towards him.</p>

                        <button class="accordion-header">Western Echo, 24th August 1886 </button>
                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>As soon as I reached home, I wrote a letter inviting him to a quiet dinner with me and to have a friendly talk with
    him afterwards. But just as I was handing the letter to a servant for delivery my dear friend was announced and a
    moment after, he ran in and embraced me in the most rapturous manner. He was himself again. I squeezed him to my
    heart and lost in the long embrace the cold reception I received from him in his own house. </p>

<p> ‚ÄòAfter dinner we withdrew to a room inaccessible to any body else in the house and where if I entered nobody was to
    be admitted by any servants. It was a room beautifully furnished according to the taste of the country. When we
    seated ourselves my friend thus commenced. ‚ÄúMy dear friend!! I need not tell you how deeply I felt the manner in
    which I was obliged to receive you the other day after long years of separation. If I tell you that it was on
    account of the woman to whom I introduced you as my wife ‚Äô I am sure you would not believe it. It is true
    nevertheless. If you expect to see me as the same open, frank and kind hearted friend and jovial fellow you will be
    sadly mistaken. Never was a man so completely transformed as I have been since the d‚Äî1 incarnate and his spouse
    darkened my door with their accursed presence:30 (excuse the expression) but I will be even with them yet, that is
    if I happen to meet them anywhere. I have determined to follow them even to the end of the world to be avenged, the
    accursed meddlers! Would you believe that I and my beautiful<span class="personal-name-7">Abigail</span>31 were
    having one of our usual rows when you were announced? ana do you now wonder at the nature of the reception I gave
    you? That moment I felt that I could kill that woman outright and be hung for jt. but your presence put a stop to
    the row thereby saving me. I must beg you to pardon me for the incoherent way in which I have expressed myself;
    I-really can- not help myself.‚Äù Here he stopped to collect his thoughts and cool his excited spirit, and then
    commenced thus: - ‚ÄúYou must be aware that before you left me in order to proceed to your country I was living in
    single blissfulness; I was a happy man then. Shortly after your departure desiring to fill the vacancy which your
    absence occasioned I thought that I could do no better than to take to myself a companion; for a friend of less
    degree than that could not compensate me for the loss I had sustained by your being away from me. It was not long
    before I found in the woman who is now my wife all that I could desire. We were married according to our own custom
    which gives either of us liberty to disconnect ourselves from each other should we find that instead of the marriage
    creating happiness which is the chief aim of such unions it created misery. For more than two years neither of us
    had cause to repent the change we had made in our former lives. Neither of us would change the other for another
    companion, so perfect was our happiness. But no happiness in this world could be called perfect; none would last
    long without any alloy, and ours came from a source we the least expected. A man exceedingly prepossessing
    appearance and This wife' came and took lodgings in our house as he looked very respectable we gave them the best
    apartments. The business that brought them to the city was to introduce a new kind of Religion. The doctrines they
    preached were such as it seemed the people were ripe to embrace. Among the customs which this worthy couple tried to
    introduce was the marriage rite. This found a great number of advocates in the ranks of our women: they must be
    married according to the rites this new religion contemplated; and among these female advocates my wife was the most
    zealous and no wonder, since she and the female lodger of mine had become firm friends. You know my dear friend that
    I hate every thing that has an innovating influence, and I need not tell you that I was the leader of those men who
    set up their hearts against this interference in our marriage custom, although in every other doctrine they
    introduced I was in accord with them especially polygamy. Mr Baptista" (my lodger's name) had a great liking for me;
    he would make a proselyte of me he used to say; and but for his interference in our marriage custom I certainly
    would have been a strenuous discipline of his. To make a long story short my wife became unhappy; nothing short of
    the solemnization of our marriage to the new religion would satisfy her. Domestic infelicity is outrageous, and I
    caught it. Besides which, I was assisted every day by Mr and Mrs Baptista; 'set an exam- le bright for others to
    follow and thou shalt be rewarded', they used to tell me and they were right; for am I not rewarded!! Well, it is no
    use crying over spilt milk. In short with my eyes wide open, I suffered myself to be bamboozled and the marriage was
    again solemnized. Thus I woefully changed substance for a shadow, happiness for misery; and you return to meet your
    dear jovial friend the most wretched man living. My wife, the obedient loving girl, the pride of my life, the solace
    of my evil days is turned into the very incarnation of a curse in my own house and I cannot send her away on account
    of the oath I took at the ceremony. As the surviving twin-brother - whom nature had attached together - was obliged
    to carry about his poor dead brother with him wherever he went so I am doomed by my oath to carry this incubus, this
    woman about with me. </p>

<p>""Can it be possible", I asked, "that you cannot send her away in spite of all the misery which probably may result
    in your premature death?" </p>

<p>""No," my friend replied, "unless either she or I commit adultery which I will not do if I can help myself."</p>

<p>"But I am afraid you have not told me about this new kind of marriage," I asked my friend. "For I do not see how it
    could change the amiable disposition of a woman like your wife when she was living with you as a country wife, to
    one of so acrimonious or acidulous a nature, as you tell me, in her second or the new marriage?" </p>

<p>""I thought it was not necessary," my friend replied. "There were many advantages held out to them (the women) in
    this new marriage, but the greatest among these advantages which takes their fancy the most is in the fact that she
    and her children begotten by me or she alone in the absence of children become entitled to my property should she
    survive me, whilst she on the other hand has got nothing to leave me were I to survive her. This coupled with the
    fact that you cannot send her away and other advantages this marriage gives gives, has made her so proud and
    unbearably independent of the man who has made her what she is that at times I have even conceived a notion of
    killing her and myself to end my misery.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúMy dearest friend, and benefactor,‚Äù rejoined I, cut to the very heart with grief and sorrow, ‚ÄúI would most
    willingly, if I could, share your grief with you, but that is impossible. If I could restore you the happiness which
    you have lost, by sacrificing all that I possess, I would most willingly throw it to the winds so that you might be
    what you were before, but it is utterly impossible as you lead me to understand. But you can learn to endure what
    you cannot help. In perplexity and distress both of mind and body, it is only the wise who. forbear and are patient,
    and in the very forbearance and patience that they exercise learn the way how to get out of the difficulty. Both of
    you I can see have not lost the love subsisting between you; in spite of her sour disposition and ill behaviour
    towards you, which is the offspring of the union of barbarous ideas with civilized notions; of imperfect knowledge
    of the new doctrines with the old customs. I can find that she loves you as ardently as ever she did before or else
    why should she wish to tie herself to you for life? It is in this very love that you can effect a reconciliation and
    bring her to the knowledge of her duty towards you.</p>
